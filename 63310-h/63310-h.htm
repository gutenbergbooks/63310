<p><i>To those</i>, <i>I think a lessening number</i>, <i>who may
find themselves at variance with</i> &ldquo;<i>my
Rector&rsquo;s</i>&rdquo; <i>theology</i>, <i>I tender the
following quotation from one of the ablest and deepest thinkers
of the past century</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If, instead of the &lsquo;glad
tidings&rsquo; that there exists a Being in whom all the
excellences which the highest human mind can conceive exist in a
degree inconceivable to us, I am informed that the world is ruled
by a Being whose attributes are infinite, but what they are we
cannot learn, nor what are the principles of his government,
except that &lsquo;the highest human morality which we are
capable of conceiving&rsquo; does not sanction them; convince me
of it, and I will bear my fate as I may.&nbsp; But when I am told
that I must believe this, and at the same time call this Being by
the names which express and affirm the highest human morality, I
say in plain terms I will call no being good who is not what I
mean when I apply that epithet to my
fellow-creatures.&rdquo;&mdash;J. S. <span

Hamilton&rsquo;s Philosophy</i>, pp. 102, 103 (Criticism of
Mansel).</p>

1</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Riverdale</span> and I&mdash;to wit one
Harold Stirling by name&mdash;had been close friends almost since
life began, at our private school, our public school, and again
at college.&nbsp; And we were meeting now for the last time as
undergraduates in Riverdale&rsquo;s rooms at Cambridge.&nbsp; For
the choice that comes, once at any rate in a lifetime, to all,
had come to us, and we had chosen divergent, to some it would
appear antagonistic, careers.</p>
<p>To judge from his personal appearance, Riverdale at any rate
had chosen wisely for himself when he elected to become an
artist.&nbsp; Smoking at <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>his ease, in a picturesque environment
of flowers and ferns, pictures and statuettes, he looked like
what he was&mdash;a well-to-do indolent dreamer, who might
possibly succeed as a painter, but would never make much of life
in any other line.&nbsp; Fortunately for him he had no need to
trouble himself about the future.&nbsp; A kindly fate had settled
all this in advance, when his only surviving relative, an uncle,
had made him a comfortable allowance of a thousand a year, adding
the still more comfortable assurance that the family estate of
Riverdale should be his when the time came that he himself should
have no further use for it.</p>
<p>Study him, as the glow from a reading-lamp falls full on his
features, and you will say that his personality is concentrated
in his eyes.&nbsp; Sapphire blue they would have been called by a
casual observer, but it always seemed to me that they held in
them a deeper tint, as of violet or purple.&nbsp; <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>But whatever
their colour, they are about as rare in humanity as is a blue
rose or a green chrysanthemum among the creations of the floral
world.&nbsp; Not that they betoken much character, I think.&nbsp;
It is simply their beauty, and perhaps their rarity, that
constitutes the attraction.&nbsp; At any rate, veiled by long
lashes, and set in Italian features, as was the case with
Riverdale, it is impossible to hold them indicative of energy or
activity in life.</p>
<p>It was a strange coincidence that had made bosom friends of
two natures so antagonistic, to all appearance, as
Riverdale&rsquo;s and mine.&nbsp; But it was a coincidence that
occurs oftener than would at first sight seem possible.&nbsp;
Perhaps it is explicable by the well-known theory that every
character is on the search for its complement.&nbsp; If so, it
may well be that my own sturdy directness found its natural
relaxation in the captivating indifferentism of my friend.&nbsp;
Anyhow, the companionship had <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>begun early at school, where a mutual
admiration for one&rsquo;s opposite is often the secret of a
lifelong friendship.&nbsp; And as Riverdale&rsquo;s good looks
and careless insouciance had always been found irresistible, it
was my own commonplace personality that was envied by my
schoolfellows for the dignity it had acquired by his
friendship.</p>
<p>And now that I have given you an idea of my friend, let me for
once attempt the impossible and try to describe myself.&nbsp; An
athlete I think I may call myself, for I have raced and rowed and
played cricket and football ever since I was a boy of
ten&mdash;of the type which is welcomed in all our schools as the
recognised trainer of youth.&nbsp; Not so very plain, I hope, and
certainly well set up in the way of muscles and sinews.&nbsp; But
quite as certainly not in any way striking like Riverdale, and
without the faintest pretension to anything remarkable in the
direction of beauty.&nbsp; Finally, and to complete <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the portrait,
fair in complexion, with blue eyes and a slight tendency to
freckles, which I abominate.&nbsp; In all respects a worthy foil
to Riverdale&rsquo;s dreamy picturesqueness.</p>
<p>Left an orphan at an early date, with a comfortable income of
&pound;300 a year, I had never known the want of money, though I
had no large balance to waste on the luxuries that had become
necessaries to my friend.&nbsp; Without any real talent, and
notwithstanding my devotion to athletics, I had taken a fair
degree, and learned something of theology under the guidance of
one of the leading minds at Cambridge.&nbsp; Only as yet I had
come to no conclusions outside the main doctrines of our faith;
and to what end my views were shaping themselves I had never
paused on my way to consider.&nbsp; Experience and circumstances,
as they developed themselves, would, I supposed, answer the
question, and, having been confronted as yet <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>by no definite
difficulties, I had not troubled to bethink me how I should meet
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me, Eric,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;where are
all the Cupids and Psyches and Fauns to go while you are painting
dusky Venetians and the fair-haired beauties of Genoa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve taken a flat, Harold, in a house
overlooking Battersea Park, and they&rsquo;ll all be transferred
there as soon as I am off to-morrow.&nbsp; By the way, you must
look in on them now and then, and see that they are all
right.&nbsp; And you must have that little gladiator I brought
from Rome for yourself.&nbsp; It would never do to separate you,
for I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;d never be happy without him.&nbsp;
Rather like you, I think he is, with his steady sturdy gaze, as
if he knew he had a tough business before him, but intended to
make the best of it, and worry through.&nbsp; Lucky we
weren&rsquo;t born in each other&rsquo;s shoes, any way for me,
Harold.&nbsp; I <a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>couldn&rsquo;t have faced life without funds, but should
have drifted down and down till I ended the business with a dose
of morphia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense, Eric.&nbsp; I do wish you wouldn&rsquo;t
cheapen yourself like that.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve talent enough for
both of us, and will be exhibiting in the Academy while I&rsquo;m
a country curate, and a poor one at that.&nbsp; By the way, if
you don&rsquo;t mind, I&rsquo;d sooner have that Antinous than
the gladiator.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t particularly want a replica of
myself, if it&rsquo;s all the same to you, while you might have
posed for the Antinous, if you&rsquo;d been handy; and it will be
better than nothing to have it to look at when I haven&rsquo;t
got the original on the other side of the table.&nbsp; And now,
old friend, good-bye.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s past twelve already, and
I&rsquo;ve all my packing to do before the morning.&nbsp; For I
shall be off long before a sybarite like you thinks of
stirring.&nbsp; Let me hear from you now and then, and
don&rsquo;t let the <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>foreign signoras and Roman models steal all your heart
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day we had parted; he to enjoy life and study art in
all the best galleries on the continent, and I to prepare myself
for Ordination in a quiet village of the West.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a cheerful scene on which my
eye rested as I looked out upon it from the Rector&rsquo;s study,
while awaiting my introduction to the Rector himself.&nbsp; Two
large bay windows opened on a terrace, from which a short flight
of steps led down to a lawn, fringed with gaily-coloured flower
beds.&nbsp; Through the open windows streamed into the room a
veritable flood of light and air, creating an atmosphere in which
sadness and depression would have been hopelessly out of
place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; I murmured, &ldquo;to write a gloomy
Calvinistic sermon in a room like this, though it&rsquo;s
strange, by the way, that his letters should have told me nothing
of his views.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>The
emerald lawn in the foreground contrasted pleasantly with the
violet haze that rested on the far horizon, and the very air
itself seemed steeped in quiet and repose.&nbsp; Only the song of
birds and the mysterious hum of insect-life broke the stillness
of the summer day, to which the chafing of a trout stream, as it
murmured over its rocky bed at the foot of the Rectory garden,
sounded a soft accompaniment.</p>
<p>And out past the Rectory grounds, past the cheery meadow-land
beyond, where reaping was now in progress, I caught a glimpse of
the far off sea and the Isle of Portland lying on the line of the
horizon, with a delicate veil of summer gauze folded about its
head.&nbsp; The charm of it all wove a spell upon me like a
dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the Rector is as nice as his Rectory, I shall have a
pleasant time of it,&rdquo; I said to myself.&nbsp; And the next
moment the unspoken thought was <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>answered in the affirmative, for I
felt my hand warmly grasped by the gentlest-looking and most
benevolent of men.&nbsp; And my heart went out to him on the
instant, as to one whose help and guidance I knew would never
fail me, even when my work under him should be ended, and,
whether for good or evil, laid behind me among the retrospects of
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said, after studying me
keenly for half-a-minute with eyes that pierced me through and
through.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d work hard in the
right way, and make friends with my villagers and
parishioners.&nbsp; They are a queer lot&mdash;to be led, not
driven.&nbsp; Above all, you look as if you had no foolish fads
or fancies&mdash;the only things I can&rsquo;t tolerate when
there is so much real work to be done.&nbsp; And you&rsquo;ll be
content to do it closely on the lines laid down for us all in the
Sermon on the Mount, before Christianity, as <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Christ left
it, had lost its identity among a crowd of sects and
superstitions.&nbsp; By the way, you must have been surprised, I
imagine, that I asked no questions in my letters as to your
opinions, and gave you no hints about my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I care more
for what a man does than for what he thinks, and if you will look
after my cottagers, soul and body&mdash;beginning with the body
first&mdash;you and I will get on well together, no matter what
opinions you hold on all the open questions of the day.&nbsp; Of
course I don&rsquo;t use the term &lsquo;open&rsquo; of anything
plainly taught us in the Gospel narrative and the precepts of our
Church.&nbsp; Though even the latter, as it seems to me, might
have been conceived in a somewhat wider spirit without being wide
enough to embrace the Christianity of Christ.&nbsp; And for this
reason I am altogether opposed to commissions and enquiries of
any kind that might impose <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>still further limits and restrictions
where He Himself has made none.&nbsp; What are wanted for the
Church are active energetic workmen, and the wider the doors are
thrown open the more of them we shall get for the work.&nbsp;
Think what missionary effort itself could accomplish if all its
labourers were content to waive, one and all of them, their
private specifics, and preach only the clear unquestioned truths
which the Master Himself has sanctioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On all questions but these you may hold what theories
you will&mdash;that the world was created in six days or in six
times as many millions of years; that the Old Testament miracles
were literal facts, or allegories for the suggestion of
much-needed truths.&nbsp; And you may hold, if you will, that no
creature that has life will perish.&nbsp; We are told, are we
not? that He &lsquo;will save both man and beast,&rsquo; which
means, if its means anything, that <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>other creatures besides man will have
a portion in the future state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think well and carefully before you teach an
Eternity of Punishment.&nbsp; The responsibility of doing so is
far too grave to be carelessly incurred in the light of a wider
and clearer-sighted knowledge.&nbsp; Almost it seems that the
guess which Charlotte Bront&euml; hazarded in the mouth of one of
her characters will before long have crystallized into doctrine:
&lsquo;No; I cannot believe that.&nbsp; I hold another creed,
which no one ever taught me, and which I never mention, but in
which I delight, and to which I cling, for it extends hope to
all; it makes eternity a rest&mdash;a mighty home, not a terror
and an abyss.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all things, do not confuse your mind and paralyse
your energies with the question, so all-engrossing now-a-days, of
the co-existence of good and evil, of joy and sorrow, in the
world, <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>which is after all no mystery at all.&nbsp; Or, if there
be a mystery, surely it lies in the fact that anyone should have
thought a world of infinite perfection possible.&nbsp; Why, the
fallacy was refuted by Plato himself, to whom it was a
self-evident truth that the creations of The Infinite must needs
be finite and imperfect: in other words, not
&lsquo;infinitely&rsquo; but only &lsquo;very&rsquo; good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Limitation, imperfection and (by consequence) evil,
with their natural development in sin and suffering and death,
were the inevitable portion of created life, but accompanied
(thank heaven!) with a birthright of possibilities for good,
that, rightly used here and hereafter, shall make us worthy of
association, at the last perhaps of union, with the Infinite
Itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me if my sermon has wearied you.&nbsp; I can at
any rate summarise it in brief.&nbsp; Teach mainly what has come
to us directly <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>from our Master&rsquo;s lips&mdash;first and foremost,
the paramount duty of unselfishness; it embodies the whole duty
of man to man, and a part at least of his duty to his
Creator.&nbsp; And remember that those who came after Him were
after all but men, not exempt from the bias of inclination and
judgment, who sometimes (it is quite possible) may have obscured
where they thought to enlighten.&nbsp; To be followed therefore
with all care and caution whenever they defined or limited what
He left wide enough to embrace the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you will dine with me to-night,&rdquo; he
added cheerily, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll try to make amends for the
penance I have inflicted on you.&nbsp; Besides, I want your
opinion on the trout from the Rectory stream.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Like</span> his brother at the Manor House
hard by, my Rector, Mr. Richardson, was a widower, having lost
his wife only six months before my arrival.&nbsp; His family was
comprised of four children, whose ages descended by even
gradations from Reginald, the eldest, a handsome lad of eighteen
whose school-life had just ended, down to Aggie the youngest, a
wild little maiden of twelve.</p>
<p>As yet their characters were still unformed, and had been
entrusted for their development to a clever little Belgian,
Josephine Armand by name, <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>who, in addition to the
superintendence of their education, managed the Rector&rsquo;s
household for him, and ruled the domestics with a rod of
iron.</p>
<p>On the day after my arrival I was studying the church and the
streets of the village, which radiated like a fan from the foot
of the hill where I stood, when I was met by Reginald who had
dined with us the evening before.&nbsp; He was to start early the
next day for the continent, where he was to pick up what foreign
languages he could before he entered at Cambridge in the
following October.</p>
<p>By the gate of the churchyard, through which we passed to the
Rectory, stood a time-worn placard requesting visitors not to
touch any of the flowers &ldquo;excepting those on their own
graves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A remarkable instance of realistic prevision,&rdquo;
said Reggie, &ldquo;and far too good to be improved away.&nbsp;
Fortunately our villagers are not keenly appreciative of humour,
else the best joke in the <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>county would have been lost to us
long ago.&nbsp; And what are you up to, my children?&rdquo; he
added, looking in at the window of the Rectory schoolroom, where
his sisters were busily writing at the untidiest of tables,
forgetful for once of the glorious sunshine that blazed down upon
the world outside.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some mischief, I&rsquo;ll be
bound, else you&rsquo;d never be so abnormally quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go on, and don&rsquo;t disturb us, Reggie,&rdquo;
said Agnes, a lean wiry girl, with hair much dishevelled under
the excitement of composition.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are busy preparing
verses for the Attar competition prize, the new dentifrice, you
know; you may hear mine if you like.&nbsp; I go in for plain and
simple fact&mdash;&lsquo;beauty unadorned&rsquo; you see:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Carbolic, camphor, chalk are done;<br />
Attar is all and all in one.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Admirable, Aggie.&nbsp; Good solid sense, and no
foolish striving after the artistic.&nbsp; And now for <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>yours,
Gertie.&nbsp; Being the poetess of the family, you won&rsquo;t be
content with stern simplicity like that.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s love
and lovemaking in yours, I&rsquo;ll be bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Reggie, I <i>have</i> tried to add a little
romance to it.&nbsp; But somehow or other the teeth don&rsquo;t
seem to lend themselves readily to the genius of poetry:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;If Attar you had used in time,<br />
Your teeth would have been white&mdash;like mine;<br />
But now my love for you is dead:<br />
Another, &rsquo;nother girl I&rsquo;ll wed.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Gertie!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re really
brilliant.&nbsp; &lsquo;Time&rsquo; rhymes admirably with
&lsquo;mine,&rsquo; and it&rsquo;s a stroke of true genius to
intensify grief by the simple process of prodelision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you like it, Reggie, though I
haven&rsquo;t the faintest notion of what
&lsquo;prodelision&rsquo; means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Nellie, for yours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve a rooted
belief that yours will be the prize-winner.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>a clever head
on your shoulders, and can make a good guess at what will
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mine <i>is</i> rather a bold venture,
Reggie.&nbsp; I want, you see, to combine the allied arts of
painting and poetry.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s to be a picture of King
Attar at the top, launching thunderbolts at a crowd of flying
dentists.&nbsp; Off they go in the distance, with their
implements of torture in their hands, and at the bottom of the
picture these words are written:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;King Attar and the dentists see;<br />
Choose Attar&mdash;and the dentists flee!&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I wish I were handier at drawing.&nbsp; King Attar in his
chair of state is all out of perspective.&nbsp; And the flying
dentists look like a lot of daddy-longlegs; while as for their
implements, they might be anything you please.&nbsp; However, I
can easily remedy that by drawing lines to the margin with an
explanation of each particular instrument&mdash;<a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>&lsquo;these
are tweezers,&rsquo; &lsquo;this is a file&rsquo;&mdash;like
Melton Prior does in his war pictures, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve got everything cut and
dried, I see.&nbsp; Though, by the way, you needn&rsquo;t talk
bad grammar under the stimulus of composition.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
your governess teach you that &lsquo;like Melton Prior
does&rsquo; is bad grammar?&nbsp; If not, she isn&rsquo;t worth
her salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our French, Reggie, that troubles her more
than our English.&nbsp; At any rate, when she called us in to
dinner yesterday, I said, &lsquo;<i>Je suis
d&eacute;j&agrave;</i>,&rsquo; meaning, of course, &lsquo;I am
all ready,&rsquo; and she had just the faintest suspicion in the
world that I intended it for a joke, and boxed my ears on the
chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And served you jolly well right for your cheek.&nbsp;
But I can&rsquo;t stop chattering here.&nbsp; Give me half the
prize if you get it, for the encouragement I&rsquo;ve given
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>As the
door closed upon him something suspiciously like the sound of a
kiss was heard in the corridor outside, whereupon the door
re-opened and a laughing face peeped in at the children.</p>
<p>A dainty little personage she was, to whom her cousin Reggie
had long ago given his heart.&nbsp; And a pretty picture she made
in the school-room as the sunlight fell on her hair from the
window opposite, and warmed its ruddy glow to the famed Venetian
tint.&nbsp; Not the very highest type of beauty, perhaps.&nbsp;
At any rate the best masters of antiquity would not have
sanctioned the tip-tilted nose and over-large mouth.&nbsp; Yet
even they could have found no fault with the delicate poise of
the head, the shapely neck, above all, with the tawny hazel eyes
and slyly drooping lids; and you must have gone direct to the
Faun of the Capitol if you had wished to rival the sunny
brightness of the face, and the rippling smile that played about
her <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>lips.&nbsp; Almost one expected to catch a glimpse of
the pointed ears which Donatello was supposed to conceal behind
his curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you pickles,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;and
where&rsquo;s your guardian angel Josephine gone?&nbsp; Not left
you to your own devices if she&rsquo;s a wise woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s off to the garden, Cousin Marion,
&lsquo;to cut a cabbage to make an apple pie,&rsquo; as Verdant
Green said.&nbsp; I mean she&rsquo;s gone to dig up all the weeds
and dandelions that lie handy.&nbsp; &lsquo;It must be,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;that I have herbs&mdash;savage herbs&mdash;to
aid the digestion.&rsquo;&nbsp; Only the other day she half
poisoned herself with celandine roots, which she thought looked
promising for the composition of a salad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as good as another gardener,&rdquo; put in
Gertie, &ldquo;and does all the weeding.&nbsp; Besides,
she&rsquo;s so beautifully tidy, and consumes all that she gets,
<a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>like a
well-regulated bonfire.&nbsp; But do stay a minute and help us,
Marion.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re making poetry to win the Attar
Competition.&nbsp; Do give us a verse or two; we&rsquo;ve used up
all our ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I, my child?&nbsp; Why, I never made a line of
poetry in my life, and hardly ever remembered one.&nbsp; See how
the very thought of it has made me fly.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the door
she looked back laughing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reggie, you kissed me just outside
the door;<br />
Use Attar, or don&rsquo;t kiss me any more!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, laughing still, she fled&mdash;fortunately without seeing
me, who had watched the proceedings unobtrusively from the
shelter of a friendly clematis.</p>
<h2><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> found lodgings with one Peggy
Ransom, whom I soon discovered to be one of the chief characters
in the village, as the Rector had reported her.&nbsp; A tiny old
lady she was, with a small and shrivelled face, like a Ribston
pippin that had survived well on into April, and bright beady
eyes that always reminded me of a squirrel&rsquo;s.&nbsp; She
had, too, something of the same small creature&rsquo;s animal
vivacity, and talked in a queer little chirpy strain that
suggested its note of satisfaction when it has lighted upon a
particularly fine nut or acorn.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>In
dress she was scrupulously neat, though in the dress of some
pre-historic age.&nbsp; For example, she never appeared without a
silk &rsquo;kerchief bound over her head, because, as she said,
you never &ldquo;knew where a draught might find you, and
prevention was better than cure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Sundays and holidays she appeared resplendent in a black
silk gown, which, she told me with pride, could &ldquo;stand of
itself in the days when the Rector gave it her&rdquo;&mdash;how
many years before I had never had the rudeness to enquire.&nbsp;
But it was still a fine article of raiment, and had been
preserved with such scrupulous care that even in its old age it
still retained its dignity.</p>
<p>She was not, I found, a heart-whole admirer of the
Rector&rsquo;s opinions.&nbsp; &ldquo;As good and kindly a
gentleman,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;as ever trod in shoeleather,
and a real Christian.&nbsp; But takes things a bit too
pleasantly, I allow, and makes out the next world <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>to be a more
comfortable place than some of us, I fear, will find it.&nbsp;
Not but what &rsquo;tis better that way than to go about, as some
of us do, with faces sad enough to sour the cream, finding no
pleasure in all the gifts the Almighty has showered upon
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had lost her husband and all her family one by one, and
found the joy of her life in the Rector and the Rectory children,
who were always in and out of the kitchen, worrying her and
hindering her work, it seemed to me, though she would never hear
a word from anyone against them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless their
hearts,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a lone and
dreary old body without them, though I do wish that child Aggie
would come up the garden path like a Christian, instead of
jumping over the flower-beds and tempting the cats to play
hide-and-seek among my lilies of the valley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of all the Rectory children Reginald was <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>her first and
special favourite.&nbsp; This was unfortunate for me.&nbsp; Not
but what I liked the lad&mdash;what little I had seen of him
before he left for the continent.&nbsp; But it was tedious to be
reminded so often of his perfections.&nbsp; Besides, I had a
lively remembrance of the love-scene that had passed between him
and his cousin on the day that followed my arrival, which for
some reason or other I had thought out of place and
unseasonable.&nbsp; Though of course I had no right to begrudge
two cousins the pleasure of a cousinly salutation, and perhaps,
if Marion had been old and ill-favoured, I should have found no
temptation to do so.&nbsp; As it was, and for whatever reason, I
was glad that Reggie was for the moment out of the field of my
vision.&nbsp; And I should have tried to forget the liberty, for
so I called it, that he had taken in kissing her, if only Peggy
had not so strongly insisted on the nearness and intimacy of
their relations.&nbsp; She was for ever <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>harping on
Reggie&rsquo;s good looks&mdash;he was well enough I admit, but,
after all, nothing to compare with Riverdale&mdash;and what a
handsome pair they&rsquo;d make, and how suitable the match would
be.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Master Reginald just worships the ground
under her feet,&rdquo; she would add; as if I couldn&rsquo;t see
that much without Peggy&rsquo;s interference.&nbsp; And then she
would look slyly at me and say, &ldquo;I suppose <i>you</i> think
her good-looking, don&rsquo;t you, sir?&nbsp; The two curates who
were here before you both made eyes at her&mdash;really Peggy, I
thought, you can be a little vulgar at times&mdash;indeed, I may
say it was for that reason they left us, and because they saw
they had no chance against Master Reginald.&nbsp; It is true they
were none too well favoured&mdash;short and dark the first was,
and the last one thin and scraggy.&nbsp; Not but what he was
beautifully fair in complexion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a while after this interview Peggy and I <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>were at
variance.&nbsp; Every scrap of her information had been
distasteful to me, especially her reference to the complexion of
the curate who had preceded me, in which I detected, however
gratuitously, an allusion to that slight tendency to freckles
which I thought somewhat marred my own completeness.</p>
<p>But on the whole Peggy and I got on capitally together, and
she was in most respects an ideal landlady for a curate who was
new and strange to his surroundings.&nbsp; She had lived her life
in the parish, and knew its landmarks as no one else knew
them.&nbsp; Besides, she amused me with her gossip, especially
when I could draw her on the subject of the Rector and his
theories, which she was never weary of discussing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; she would say
authoritatively, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s none too strict, to my way of
thinking, in the matter of church-going.&nbsp; Only the other day
he said to me &lsquo;Yes, Peggy, church-going is good <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>for all of
us, not but what we may have too much of it&rsquo;&mdash;did ever
woman hear the like from her minister?&mdash;or rather we may
follow it to the exclusion of better things.&nbsp; To <i>do</i>
the thing we ought is better than to <i>listen to</i> it, and
I&rsquo;d come down easy on any one who stayed away from Church
to do a kind act for a neighbour.&nbsp; Unluckily it&rsquo;s
usually to please ourselves, and not to help our neighbours, that
we fight so shy of our Church.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her little peculiarities Peggy was wonderfully
diverting.&nbsp; For example, whenever she found herself in
difficulties, as when the potatoes were hard, or the meat
overdone, she would take refuge in the platitude,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done my best: I can no more,&rdquo; thus
casting all her care upon Fate as the inscrutable power which had
wrought the mischief and must take the responsibility.&nbsp; She
was also a firm believer in the guidance of astrology, always
planting <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>her flowers and vegetables when two benign planets were
in conjunction, and avoiding with scrupulous care the baleful
influence of Mars and Saturn.&nbsp; Only I wish she had abstained
more wisely from words of which she had not mastered the meaning,
as when she told me they had been &ldquo;hanging a hamlet&rdquo;
in the Rectory garden, or &ldquo;keeping the university&rdquo; of
the King&rsquo;s birthday!</p>
<p>There was something else by the way that gave Peggy Ransom a
special interest in my eyes.&nbsp; She had been housekeeper at
the Manor House in the days of Marion&rsquo;s youth, but had left
it fifteen years before to form her own ill-fated marriage.</p>
<p>It was not much, but I suppose it was better than nothing, for
an incipient lover like myself to learn at first-hand what his
lady-love was like in the days of her infancy.&nbsp; But either
Peggy&rsquo;s memory was failing her, or her love for the Rectory
children had made her forgetful of her earlier charge, for <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>her
reminiscences of Marion at that age were hardly of absorbing
interest, being limited for the most part to a rambling catalogue
of childish illnesses, and the skill with which Peggy had treated
them.&nbsp; But possibly in the very warmest heart it would be
difficult to stimulate raptures by a record of what your
lady-love was doing at the early age of five.</p>
<p>This afternoon, for example, I had reached the stage at which
Marion was recovering from a vague and mysterious illness called
&ldquo;thrush,&rdquo; when we were interrupted by Aggie, who, as
usual, made a bee-line towards us in flying leaps and bounds
across the garden beds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a letter for
you, Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;from the Manor
House.&nbsp; Uncle Edgar wants you to dine with him this evening
at eight.&nbsp; I told him you had no engagement; besides, Marion
who came with him said she was dying to make your
acquaintance.&nbsp; But <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>you must hurry up and dress for
it&rsquo;s past seven already.&rdquo;&nbsp; As she spoke, she had
pounced on Peggy&rsquo;s two cats&mdash;Toby and Sambo by
name&mdash;who were reposing peacefully on the porch above our
heads, and was off again home down the garden with the pair of
them close at her heels, all the three doing their level best to
break off as many flowers as possible in their passage down the
garden.</p>
<p>There were to be only four of us at dinner that evening.&nbsp;
In the ignorance of my heart I rejoiced at Reggie&rsquo;s
absence, little thinking that, before the evening was over, I
should have been glad to welcome his cousinly attentions to
Marion as a far less dangerous rivalry than the one which was
suddenly to burst upon me from a quarter wholly beyond the range
of my vision.</p>
<h2><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> old Manor House was looking its
best, as half an hour later I walked up through the avenue by
which it was approached.</p>
<p>Planted against the south-west side of a hill, the ground
gently falling away in front of it, it caught the evening sun,
which burnished the trees on either side, and called up all the
lovely shades of colour that lie dormant in old red brick, as the
fires that are latent in opal and carbuncle wake up at the touch
of light.&nbsp; It is the fashion already to disparage Ruskin,
and to find that we have over-rated <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>him like so many of our heroes, but
at any rate he was right in his devotion to the fine red brick of
Elizabethan architecture.&nbsp; One marvels how any one who has
looked upon Hatfield or Aston can condescend to build in any
other medium.&nbsp; There is much stone, I know&mdash;Ham Hill by
preference&mdash;that takes a lovely colouring from age, to which
lichen and stonecrop and ivy would seem to have an instinctive
affinity.&nbsp; But the setting provided by Nature, and the
requirements of our dull uncongenial atmosphere find their proper
complement, I think, in a brick-dust red, just as surely as they
repudiate its vile twin brother, the white and yellow clay which
time in its progress only makes more and more disreputable.</p>
<p>That evening, for the first time, I recognised that I was in
love with Marion&mdash;a love that must have had in it no steps
and no gradations.&nbsp; The <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>leap must have been taken at a bound
on the day that I caught my first glimpse of her in the Rectory
nursery, though I suppose time added fresh strength to my
devotion by developing fresh features of sympathy and mutual
interest.</p>
<p>Our party, as I have said, was limited to four, and as the
Rector and his brother at once paired off for the evening, Marion
was left to my care, and our acquaintance progressed rapidly.</p>
<p>Squire Richardson was, in character and even in appearance, a
replica of his brother&mdash;a replica with a single
difference.&nbsp; The Squire loved foxhunting with all the
devotion of a country gentleman, while to the Rector it was the
one sport above all others of which he was intolerant.&nbsp; They
had hardly sat down to dinner when the question turned up, and it
was nearly over before they had threshed it out without the
smallest advantage to either side.&nbsp; The Rector was the
assailant.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>&ldquo;How, Edgar, you can possibly justify the cruelty
of hunting an animal which you can&rsquo;t eat, or use for any
purpose when you&rsquo;ve killed it, I can&rsquo;t
conceive.&nbsp; Talk of a bull-fight&mdash;nonsense, why
it&rsquo;s a fair fight by comparison.&nbsp; The bull is Master
of Ceremonies up to the time of its death, and then it&rsquo;s
killed painlessly by a single blow.&nbsp; And its flesh serves
the best purpose imaginable, for it&rsquo;s distributed round
among the poor of the city, who, but for the chance, would never
taste any meat but pork from one year&rsquo;s end to
another.&nbsp; Only the other day I had a specimen of the methods
of your sport.&nbsp; A miserable fox that had been kept in
agonies of terror for half-an-hour was hunted out of its shelter
behind a rock, and deliberately torn to pieces in a shallow lake
to which it had taken itself as a last refuge.&nbsp; Justify
that, Edgar, if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Walter,&rdquo; was the Squire&rsquo;s
reply.&nbsp; <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;The case was one in a thousand.&nbsp; The sport,
man, is the making of the British yeoman&mdash;breeds pluck and
manliness and good riders and good fellowship, and a hundred
other virtues.&nbsp; Besides, what of the horses in a
bull-fight?&nbsp; Have they any of the sport which you tell me
the bull enjoys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;no.&nbsp; I grant you have me there.&nbsp;
Only unluckily it can&rsquo;t be avoided, they told me in
Spain.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no man living, whatever his skill and
courage, who could tackle one of those wild Spanish bulls if it
came fresh and untired to his hand.&nbsp; And the horses are poor
wretched screws whose life is valueless and worse to them.&nbsp;
Besides, the bull kills them at least as painlessly as they would
die by neglect or in some knacker&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp; Only
it&rsquo;s a sport that does not bear transplanting to the
provinces.&nbsp; You must see it at Seville or Madrid&mdash;or
nowhere.&rdquo;&nbsp; And while the argument <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>between them
raged furiously, but in a perfect spirit of friendliness, Marion
and I were left to ourselves&mdash;an opportunity of which I was
not slow to avail myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butchered to make a British holiday!&rdquo; shouted the
Rector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather to give mettle to our horses and manliness to
our men!&rdquo; shouted back the Squire.</p>
<p>With a smile of despair, and a nod in my direction that
answered my unspoken query for permission to accompany her,
Marion slipt quietly through the open window out on to the
terrace, and I followed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll go on like that,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;till they&rsquo;ve finished their wine.&nbsp; And the best
of it is they never lose their temper, but end as amicably as
they began.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a really pretty object-lesson in
Christian forbearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>It was
a glorious summer evening, soft and still, with a glow in the sky
that might have been a reflection of the noontide glare, as we
went down the steps of the terrace and across the velvet sward of
the old pleasaunce out into the shrubberies beyond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder which side of the question you took at
dinner?&rdquo; I asked, anxious to find whether the advanced
theories of the Rector had found an echo in herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, on the question of hunting,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with him.&nbsp; It savours, I think, of
torturing.&nbsp; Of course it&rsquo;s difficult,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;to see where to draw the line.&nbsp; For I
don&rsquo;t think we were intended to be vegetarians.&nbsp; We
haven&rsquo;t the proper teeth, have we?&nbsp; And so it seems to
me that his distinction is a tenable one, and that we may kill
animals that are required for our use.&nbsp; If so, one
can&rsquo;t reasonably object to shooting them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
as <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>painless a death as any other, and, for his own credit,
the man who wants to shoot his game will collect the most
experienced hands he can find to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the side-issues,&rdquo; I slyly asked
her, &ldquo;arising from the possibility that all these animals
will live again?&nbsp; How shall we meet in the next world the
reproachful glances of the creatures we have slain in
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter doesn&rsquo;t trouble me at all,&rdquo; she
answered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too remote.&nbsp; Perhaps only the
ones we loved will take the forms again in which we knew
them.&nbsp; Perhaps that very love itself will be the
constraining power that shapes them to our recognition.&nbsp;
And, after all, something of the same difficulty meets us in our
own case.&nbsp; So far as I can make a guess, it may be a world
very like the present one.&nbsp; Only the animals, I hope, will
be nice and gentle, with all their bad qualities <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>eliminated.&nbsp; Anyhow, no one, certainly not my
uncle, would pretend to have a cut-and-dried formula for mapping
out the future world as they plan an undeveloped city in
America.&nbsp; All he says is that life, like matter, is, in all
probability, indestructible.&nbsp; Many persons, I know, regard
such speculations as worse than unprofitable.&nbsp; To me, on the
other hand, they seem elevating and comforting.&nbsp; And no one
can say they are unwarrantable, when we have the account of the
so-called Millennium to guide us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A strange conversation, you will think, for the first evening
of our meeting, and certainly not symptomatic of the love-making
I foreshadowed.&nbsp; But, after all, a sympathy of interests is
not a bad substratum for the growth of love.&nbsp; Already I felt
sure that this was no ordinary girl, and that she was deeply
interested in her uncle&rsquo;s theories.&nbsp; Indeed there was
perhaps just a trifle of subtlety <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>in my suggestion that I was not
disinclined to accept them.</p>
<p>And so we strolled among the dimly-lighted shrubberies,
chatting on less impracticable subjects, till the light faded out
of the sky, and the shadows fell, and the Squire shouted a
summons to us to join them in the drawing-room.</p>
<p>The &lsquo;pros&rsquo; and &lsquo;cons&rsquo; for and against
foxhunting having been exhausted over their wine, the Squire and
the Rector were now deep in discussion over matters affecting the
village.&nbsp; Now and again I heard references to a certain
mysterious council, to a meeting of which my attendance had been
requested for the following day.&nbsp; The Rector had only smiled
when he gave me the message, advising me to attend, and adding a
promise of amusement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder why you tolerate that old institution,&rdquo;
<a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>said the
Squire, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s purely ridiculous, and only brings
contempt on the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just because it is old, Edgar, that I
tolerate it&mdash;and also absolutely harmless.&nbsp; The fact is
I&rsquo;m fearfully conservative, and never meddle with old
institutions if I can possibly avoid it.&nbsp; Besides, the
members are all of them very old men, who would be sadly at a
loss if they missed their weekly reunion.&nbsp; But they are to
elect no new members, and, as it is, I revise and reverse their
resolutions, when necessary.&nbsp; So it only means they have the
pleasure of passing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something like the above I heard from time to time in the
intervals of Marion&rsquo;s singing.&nbsp; But I had little
thought to spare on it.&nbsp; My whole attention was absorbed in
a voice and execution that would have held their own in any
London concert-room.</p>
<p>It was a pure soprano, of the finest quality, <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>that had been
splendidly trained (I heard afterwards) under the best masters of
Leipzig and Dresden.&nbsp; She began with Tosti&rsquo;s familiar
ballad &lsquo;For ever and for ever&rsquo;&mdash;a song of
atrociously bad sentiment, but wedded to music that fits it
&lsquo;like a glove.&rsquo;&nbsp; Only one other writer, within
my own range of knowledge, has realised with such pathos the
depths of an infinite despair, and, if only for the closing
scenes of &lsquo;Cometh up as a Flower&rsquo; and &lsquo;Good-bye
Sweetheart,&rsquo; their authoress should stand not very far
lower than the topmost pinnacle of Fame.&nbsp; Then she passed to
a higher class of music and sang Blumenthal&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Message&rsquo; and &lsquo;Requital.&rsquo;&nbsp; And my
wonder was that even habituation could have rendered the squire
and his brother so insensitive as to prefer the discussion of
their parochial trivialities.</p>
<p>I was glad that no conversation followed when she had
ended.&nbsp; Almost in silence, which I could <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>see she
appreciated better than words, we parted.&nbsp; It was only as I
turned to say good-bye that my eye rested for a moment on a
photograph which stood on a small table in a corner near the
music stand.&nbsp; It was a portrait of Riverdale, and the
companion picture stood always before my eyes on my writing-table
at home.&nbsp; So I had gained a fresh lesson in the disquietudes
of love.&nbsp; In my case, at any rate, its course was not to lie
in smooth untroubled waters.</p>
<p>As soon as we had started on our walk back to the village, I
questioned the Rector concerning my discovery.&nbsp; &ldquo;What,
you know Riverdale?&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;and well enough to
call him your dearest friend?&nbsp; Verily the world is small
indeed, as wiser men than I have said.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a distant
cousin of Marion&rsquo;s, and, as soon as his work on the
continent is ended, this will be one of the first places that
will see him.&nbsp; For we are all devoted <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>to him, and
look forward to some faint reflection of his glory when he shall
have become a well-known artist.&nbsp; Besides, he was always
rather taken with Marion&mdash;a suitable
match&mdash;very&mdash;supposing it comes off, and I think, I may
almost say I&rsquo;m sure, it will.&rdquo;</p>

50</span>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following evening, punctually
at eight o&rsquo;clock, I presented myself at the door of the
Council Chamber.&nbsp; But the comedy which I had been promised
was not forthcoming.&nbsp; To the surprise of all of us, a
tragedy was represented in its place.</p>
<p>It was only a self-constituted Council of four, and had
nothing to do with roadways and sanitation.&nbsp; And it met in
the village inn of Fleetwater on a Saturday night, as it had met
in the same room at the same time for fifty years
previously.&nbsp; <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>It was deliberative rather than executive in character,
for its one ostensible function was to select the hymns for the
Sunday services.&nbsp; And when this was done it resolved itself
into a committee for discussing the affairs of the parish and the
nation at large.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twill be a privilege for ye, Master Stirling, to
mix for onst wi&rsquo; men as be so much older an&rsquo; wiser
nor yerself.&nbsp; For wi&rsquo; all the book-learnin&rsquo; that
has been yours at school and college, &rsquo;tis nowt but age
an&rsquo; experience as gi&rsquo;es the true wisdom.&nbsp; Life
must be well nigh ended afore as ever we begins to see the drift
an&rsquo; bearin&rsquo; on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; An&rsquo; so the young
can&rsquo;t never be wise, though, &rsquo;tis true, the aged may
sometimes be foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You will gather from the above that Joseph Weyman did not
begin by flattering me.</p>
<p>The Old Inn where we met was a picturesque thatched cottage,
that had crept up beside the <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>churchyard porch, either to shelter
itself beneath the churchyard trees, or to sanctify its
reputation by the proximity of things divine.&nbsp; And as it lay
embowered in a valley three miles from our western shore, it was
cheered rather than saddened by a gentle sighing from the sea,
alternating at times with a deep and hollow roar when a storm was
on its way towards the coast.</p>
<p>Neither was the Council Chamber without a certain
picturesqueness of its own.&nbsp; Bare it undoubtedly was, for it
boasted of only one small table, drawn up cosily across the fire,
and flanked on either side by two settees with panelled arms and
backs, designed apparently to accommodate the number of the
Council; or it may have been that the Council pre-arranged its
number to suit the accommodation supplied for it.&nbsp; For
myself, as the visitor of honour, one of those fine old chairs
that surprise one occasionally in the humblest of <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>cottages had
been introduced from the adjoining room.</p>
<p>Of course the Council could not deliberate without the
sustenance of beer and tobacco.&nbsp; And the smoke of continuous
churchwardens (I include both the man and his pipe) had toned the
colouring of the panels into a rich and tawny brown, from which
the quivering firelight was reflected as from the ebon mirror
favoured by Egyptian palmists.</p>
<p>The proceedings were opened by our drinking the health of the
King with solemn enthusiasm.&nbsp; And then, before the business
of the sitting was begun, a few words of general conversation
were held to be admissible.&nbsp; It was a former Rector who
formed the key-note of it, and a strange character he must have
been if all the stories were true that I heard of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a queer christenin&rsquo; you had once in
<a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>this
church, Mr. Weyman, or so at least I&rsquo;m told.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The speaker was one Ebenezer Higgins, an Evangelical of the most
pronounced type.&nbsp; For though he represented only a minority
of the parish, it was thought right that all phases of belief
within the Church should be represented on the Council.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, &rsquo;twas that indeed, Mr. Higgins.&nbsp; You
see, our old Rector was gettin&rsquo; aged an&rsquo; hard
o&rsquo; hearin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; when Lucy Stone handed &rsquo;n
the child, he said in his easy-goin&rsquo; pleasant way,
&lsquo;An&rsquo; what be we to call &rsquo;n, Lucy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lucy, Sir,&rsquo; she whispered&mdash;for
&rsquo;twas her first, ye see, an&rsquo; a terrible shy young
&rsquo;ooman she were&mdash;&lsquo;Lucy, Sir&mdash;same as
me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lucifer!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;&rsquo;twill
never do; &rsquo;tis heathenish, an&rsquo; wus than
heathenish.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I had to shout in his ear, while they was
a-titterin&rsquo; all round, till I hadn&rsquo;t no voice left in
me to lead the hymn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>&ldquo;Reminds me, it do,&rdquo; said Samuel
Smiley&mdash;landlord he was of the Old Inn where we
met&mdash;&ldquo;o&rsquo; when we was marryin&rsquo; Andrew and
Rebecca Blake.&nbsp; Andrew was a shy man&mdash;a very shy man he
were, same as Lucy Stone.&nbsp; You remember &rsquo;n well, Mr.
Strong.&nbsp; An&rsquo; when the time came for unitin&rsquo; them
in one, he wouldn&rsquo;t be pushed to the fore, nohow.&nbsp;
While his cousin, what was actin&rsquo; for &rsquo;n, was that
forward that any stranger in the church would ha&rsquo; taken he
for the bridegroom.&nbsp; So between the two on &rsquo;m Rector
were fairly puzzled, and afore he saw the right on
&rsquo;t&mdash;&rsquo;tis true as I sit here&mdash;he&rsquo;d
married the wrong man to the wrong &rsquo;ooman.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas like to ha&rsquo; been a troublesome business for all
on us, for once ye joins a couple, there&rsquo;s no man
can&rsquo;t put &rsquo;em asunder.&nbsp; An&rsquo; they two would
never ha&rsquo; jogged along in peace an&rsquo; harmony, one with
t&rsquo; other, as I knows, who&rsquo;ve lived next door to
Rebecca ever since she was a gal.&nbsp; Howsomever, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>luck was
wi&rsquo; us that day, for &rsquo;twas discovered in the vestry
as how his cousin, who was a sailor an&rsquo; hadn&rsquo;t come
to Fleetwater not an hour afore, was married already, an&rsquo;
had two childern.&nbsp; So back us went into Church agin
an&rsquo; wedded the proper couple.&nbsp; An&rsquo; rare
an&rsquo; thankful we was to &rsquo;scape so easily out o&rsquo;
what might ha&rsquo; made a tidy potheration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, you&rsquo;ve got the story right enough,&rdquo;
said the Chairman approvingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; now to
business, if <i>you</i> please.&nbsp; An&rsquo; thank ye kindly,
Mr. Higgins, I&rsquo;ll take another glass afore we begins.&nbsp;
It isn&rsquo;t long that&rsquo;s left me for the drinkin&rsquo;
o&rsquo; good ale, seein&rsquo; I was eighty-four yesterday,
an&rsquo; (thank God) never a drunkard, an&rsquo; not much time
for it now.&nbsp; As I told my old gran&rsquo;mother what died at
eighty-six, an&rsquo; was real afeard of a spoonful of brandy to
stay her stomach: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t ye be frettin&rsquo;
yerself, my dear old soul, &rsquo;tis they as <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>begins sooner
nor you did what has cause to fear the drink.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All had been peace and amity so far, but the discussion that
followed on the choice of the hymns threatened to be
acrimonious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There be seasons,&rdquo; said the Chairman
reflectively, &ldquo;when marriage bain&rsquo;t that satisfaction
as it ought to be.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas only just afore I came along
that I said to my wife, &lsquo;Mary Ann,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;I
be that downhearted an&rsquo; low-sperrit&rsquo;d in my mind, for
all the world as if I&rsquo;d met a buryin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; I see&rsquo;d a magpie by hisself to-day, an&rsquo; I
took off my hat to &rsquo;n, I did.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, Joseph,&rsquo; said she, when what I wanted
was cheerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cossettin&rsquo; &rsquo;long of my
downheartedness, &lsquo;Aye, Joseph, we be all on us bound to go,
and p&rsquo;raps &rsquo;tis yerself as&rsquo;ll be the
next.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis breakin&rsquo; up fast ye be, an&rsquo; no
mistake, an&rsquo; ye looks terrible rough an&rsquo; aged, ye
does.&nbsp; I doubt as <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>how ye&rsquo;ll be much longer
wi&rsquo; us.&rsquo;&nbsp; An&rsquo;, to make sure as how I
doesn&rsquo;t forget it, nowt&rsquo;ll satisfy her to-morrow but
&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no repentance in the grave,&rsquo; or one
o&rsquo; they dreary grave-diggin&rsquo; tunes as I can&rsquo;t
stomach no how.&nbsp; She says as how the childern of the parish
be gettin&rsquo; that oudacious that nowt won&rsquo;t turn
&rsquo;em from their wickedness but one of they scarin&rsquo;
terrifyin&rsquo; hymns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; right she be, to my way o&rsquo;
thinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Ebenezer Higgins.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis nowt we hear now a long but o&rsquo; the marcy
of the Lord&mdash;not a word of His judgments, an&rsquo; o&rsquo;
the fire and brimston&rsquo; what&rsquo;s in store for the
wicked.&nbsp; Where be the sense, I axes, o&rsquo;
strainin&rsquo; an&rsquo; strivin&rsquo; after the narrer gate
an&rsquo; takin&rsquo; no part in the sins an&rsquo; wickedness
o&rsquo; this wurld, if &rsquo;tis all one at the end, whether
ye&rsquo;ve been on the Lord&rsquo;s side or on
Satan&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Higgins; I can&rsquo;t go wi&rsquo; ye so
far,&rdquo; said Andrew Strong, the advanced freethinker of <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
parish.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hold nowise wi&rsquo;
scarin&rsquo; souls into the path o&rsquo; peace.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
&rsquo;tis queer to my mind, that the &rsquo;oomen of all people,
wi&rsquo; their tender hearts as wouldn&rsquo;t hurt a worm,
should be so set on punishin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; out no end to
it.&nbsp; An&rsquo; there be wiser men nor we, an&rsquo; our own
passon too, as doesn&rsquo;t find such doctrine written in the
Book, save an&rsquo; except you twists an&rsquo; turns
God&rsquo;s word to suit yer own imaginin&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
Bain&rsquo;t reasonable, it seems to I, not to gi &rsquo;us
another chance, an&rsquo; may be more nor one, same as
you&rsquo;d gi&rsquo; yer own childern if so be they crossed
an&rsquo; shamed ye.&nbsp; An&rsquo; we be told, bain&rsquo;t we?
as how there&rsquo;s preachin&rsquo; to the sperrits in the wurld
below?&nbsp; Now where be the good o&rsquo; preachin&rsquo;, I
axes, if so be that no good&rsquo;s to come to &rsquo;m along
o&rsquo; it?&nbsp; Why, even in this wurld taint no good
beatin&rsquo; an&rsquo; bastin&rsquo; yer childern wi&rsquo; out
ye throws in a word o&rsquo; hope to sweeten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;I think as how ye be right,&rdquo; said Samuel
Smiley, who was a trimmer by nature, and felt sure of his way now
that he had a majority to follow.&nbsp; &ldquo;An&rsquo; I gives
my vote for &lsquo;O &rsquo;twas a joyful sound to hear,&rsquo;
an&rsquo; some o&rsquo; they other lively tunes what leaves ye
wi&rsquo; an appetite for your vittles and doesn&rsquo;t curdle
the very food in yer stomach wi&rsquo; terror.&nbsp; An&rsquo; ye
can tell yer wife, Mr. Weyman, as how we don&rsquo;t admit no
&rsquo;oomen on this here Council, no more nor &rsquo;postle Paul
allowed &rsquo;m to be preachers an&rsquo; busybodies in the
Church.&nbsp; Shame on me to say it, but &rsquo;tis my hope as
how there&rsquo;ll be a corner or two in Heaven where th&rsquo;
&rsquo;oomen will ha&rsquo; silent tongues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was at this point, when feeling began to run high, that the
situation was saved by a remark from the Chairman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help us!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; who be
that, I wonder, starin&rsquo; in at us through the winder, just
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>as if
&rsquo;twere a raree show or a menagerie?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m blessed
if it bain&rsquo;t old Bob (you knows him well, Mr. Smiley) what
has a pension o&rsquo; five shillings from the
Government&mdash;thirteen pound a year it be&mdash;an&rsquo; how
he lives on &rsquo;t no man knows.&nbsp; For &rsquo;tis too aged
he be for work, an&rsquo; spends his time now-a-long in
pickin&rsquo; up odds an&rsquo; ends what comes ashore wi&rsquo;
the tide.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis miles he&rsquo;ll walk for a few bits
of timber or a coil of old rope as bain&rsquo;t worth sixpence
when he&rsquo;s got &rsquo;em.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis bits of
firewood he&rsquo;s got on his back now by the look
on&rsquo;t&mdash;from the wreck, I allow, what come ashore last
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you are wrong there, Mr. Weyman.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t wood from the wreck he&rsquo;s got wi&rsquo;
&rsquo;n now.&nbsp; That be all fine clean planks, new as new can
be, for &rsquo;twas straight from Norway she came, wi&rsquo; as
fine a lot of timber in her as ever I see&rsquo;d in my
life.&nbsp; An&rsquo; what he&rsquo;s got on his back be old bits
of <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>blackened wood what&rsquo;s been floatin&rsquo; by the
look on &rsquo;t for weeks in the water.&nbsp; Though why he
should ha&rsquo; been at the pains to gather &rsquo;m is more nor
I can say, wi&rsquo; all that fine new stuff afore his feet,
what&rsquo;d keep all the parishes along the coast in firewood
for years to come.&nbsp; But wi&rsquo; your permission, Mr.
Chairman, we&rsquo;ll call &rsquo;n in an&rsquo; axe him.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis a quiet God-fearin&rsquo; old chap he be, wi&rsquo; a
friendly word for everyone.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;twere sorry I
were when he left us an&rsquo; went to Bayview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Samuel Smiley who left the room in quest of him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, he won&rsquo;t come in, Mr. Weyman.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
what&rsquo;s more, I can&rsquo;t get speech wi &rsquo;n.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s gone down along the road towards th&rsquo; old church
an&rsquo; village.&nbsp; But he turned now an&rsquo; agin as if
he wanted a word wi&rsquo; us.&nbsp; An&rsquo; he looks pale
an&rsquo; frighted like&mdash;or so it seem&rsquo;d to I in the
dim light&mdash;same as if he&rsquo;d had a scare.&nbsp; May be
he <i>were</i> scared to see us all seated so serious,
discussin&rsquo; <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>questions o&rsquo; the Church and Parish.&nbsp; For
he&rsquo;s a quiet man what never intrudes hisself, &rsquo;cept
it be to beg a plug of &rsquo;bacca now an&rsquo; agin when he
meets one on the shore.&nbsp; Seems as how chewin&rsquo; be his
sole satisfaction.&nbsp; Though why he can&rsquo;t smoke his
&rsquo;bacca sensible in a pipe like the rest on us has allus
been a puzzle to I.&nbsp; May be he got the notion in the wars
agin old Boney, where he gained his pension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not sorry to be interrupted in their deliberations, for the
question of the hymns had been practically settled, and
discussion could only have tended to further embitterment, the
Council sallied forth, and I followed in their wake.&nbsp; We
found the old man still lingering by the churchyard porch, but,
as soon as he saw we were following him, he turned and continued
his walk in the direction of the village, travelling quietly, it
is true, but still at a steady rate that surprised me in so old a
man, <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>quicker by far than I should have imagined he could
walk, especially when encumbered with so heavy a load.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems queer an&rsquo; strange,&rdquo; said our
Chairman, &ldquo;why he don&rsquo;t stop an&rsquo; talk wi&rsquo;
us, when we&rsquo;ve been old friends and neighbours time out
o&rsquo; memory.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis fast he travels for
an aged man like he.&nbsp; I be out o&rsquo; breath, I be,
wi&rsquo; follerin&rsquo; &rsquo;n, an&rsquo; seems as how we
don&rsquo;t get no nigher to &rsquo;n for all our
hurry-in&rsquo;.&nbsp; An&rsquo; where on earth be he bound
for?&nbsp; One&rsquo;d fancy he were makin&rsquo; for the shore,
unless so be he intends to stop at Widder Russell&rsquo;s, for
there bain&rsquo;t no other buildin&rsquo; along the road,
&rsquo;cept the old church, an&rsquo; &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t likely
as how he be makin&rsquo; for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no; it wasn&rsquo;t Widow Russell&rsquo;s he was bound
for.&nbsp; Past the house he went, still onwards to the shore,
ever and again turning to see that we still followed him, until
he had reached the gate of the old churchyard.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Of the
old church nothing was left but the chancel.&nbsp; The main
building had been swept away by the sea in the hurricane of 1824,
and not a stone remained to show where it had formed a
continuation of the chancel.&nbsp; Of all the eccentricities that
accompany the action of water, none of a surety was ever more
surprising than this.&nbsp; Sheared as by a knife from the rest
of the building, the nave had vanished; the chancel still stood,
wreathed from head to foot in a draping of ivy, but without the
displacement of a single stone, and as solid, to all appearance,
as on the day of its erection hundreds of years ago.&nbsp; Our
parish services had long been transferred to the new church, safe
out of harm&rsquo;s way at the head of the valley.&nbsp; But the
old churchyard was&mdash;and is to this day&mdash;still used for
interments.&nbsp; And though the size of the parish has increased
since then, there is no fear of its being overcrowded yet.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>At the
gate of the churchyard he paused, and then turned into it, with a
final look behind him as if to satisfy himself that we had not
abandoned the pursuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive,&rdquo; said old Weyman, &ldquo;if he
bain&rsquo;t standin&rsquo; nigh the very bit o&rsquo; ground as
I&rsquo;d mapped out in my mind&rsquo;s eye for our next
buryin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m well nigh scared, I be, by the
thought that what we&rsquo;ve been a-follerin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t
flesh an&rsquo; blood at all, but a sperrit.&nbsp; Else why
don&rsquo;t he say a word to I, when he sees I be spent an&rsquo;
weary wi&rsquo; all this traipsin&rsquo; after &rsquo;n?&nbsp;
&rsquo;Stead of which &rsquo;tis speerin&rsquo; an&rsquo;
pointin&rsquo; he be to that plot o&rsquo; ground as if to show
us &rsquo;tis there he be choosin&rsquo; a spot for his last
restin&rsquo; place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no; again he passed on and out of the churchyard through
another gate, which opened into the same road, and steadily
pursued his way along an old smuggling lane which led straight <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>downwards to
the sea.&nbsp; And when he had reached the water&rsquo;s edge he
paused&mdash;and vanished.</p>
<p>Yes; the mystery was solved at last&mdash;the quest on which
he had led us was ended and explained.&nbsp; For there, in only
two feet of water, lay his body, encumbered as we had seen it
with its heavy load of timber, collected, it must have been, with
infinite toil and, as we now realised, at the cost of his
life.</p>
<p>In default of all certainty, the theory was accepted that he
had lost his life a fortnight previously, but where and how there
was no evidence to show.&nbsp; Probably he had over-balanced
himself in reaching for a baulk of floating timber, and had been
drifted by the ebb and flow of each recurring tide from the place
of his death&mdash;no one knew where&mdash;to the home of his
birth where he had chosen his grave.</p>
<p>A humble example of the Irony of Fate, which <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>on the day
that followed his death had strewn his path lavishly with the
objects of his quest.&nbsp; Only he was not there to gather
them.</p>
<h2><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was high time, I felt, to
reconsider my position in regard to Eric and Marion.&nbsp; At
present the former knew nothing of my residence in the
neighbourhood, or of the acquaintance I had formed with his
cousin.&nbsp; His letters, always few and intermittent, had for
some time ceased altogether.&nbsp; He was no doubt constantly on
the move from one place of interest to another; so I had been
unable to write to him the news of my appointment to Fleetwater,
and, in the light of my recent discovery, I regarded his
ignorance of my whereabouts as adding a fresh complication.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>If what
the Rector had told me was true, and Riverdale was really
inclined towards Marion, then my own position was about as
difficult a one as could well be imagined.&nbsp; Even a man more
conceited (I hope) than myself might well have paused in the
presence of such a rival.&nbsp; The very points in his
personality that had won him my devotion&mdash;his beauty and
charm and careless indifference&mdash;might well prove equally
attractive to his cousin.&nbsp; Add to which, there was his
future and assured position, both likely to tell with her father,
if not with herself, to say nothing of the chance that he might
one day win fame and distinction as a painter.</p>
<p>And against all these advantages, what had I to offer in
competition?&nbsp; Nothing, I assured myself repeatedly, nothing,
<i>nothing</i>.&nbsp; Only a poor curacy and a moderate
competence, while, of personal attraction, in comparison with
Eric, again <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>nothing, <i>nothing</i>.&nbsp; But this was the least of
all my difficulties&mdash;far worse was the being brought into
competition with my best and earliest friend; in particular, the
self-consciousness that I was a gainer by his absence.&nbsp; When
she began to talk of him, as assuredly she would do, so soon as
she knew of our friendship, how was I to answer her?&nbsp; My own
warm love and admiration for his merits would second and
stimulate her own.&nbsp; The temptation, I am thankful to say,
was gone before it was realised.&nbsp; Never, not for one moment,
did my heart fail in its duty to my friend.&nbsp; Never did the
thought even enter my mind of depreciating or disparaging his
merits that I might better my own position.&nbsp; To have
entertained the thought as possible would have seemed to me an
act of incomparable baseness.</p>
<p>However, the thought and self-examination induced by the
difficulty ended by dissipating it.&nbsp; <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The position,
I saw, was for the time being irremediable, and I ended where I
might have begun&mdash;by recognising that my own part must be
that of a simple and unprejudiced onlooker, till Fate should have
taken the guidance in her hand, and shown me in which direction
she intended to turn the scales.</p>
<p>And if my praises of him should help his chances of
success&mdash;so let it be.&nbsp; Love is not always given to the
most attractive and deserving, while if he succeeded, better he,
I said to myself, than any other.&nbsp; For him, if for anyone, I
could be content, I thought, to stand aside and efface myself,
almost without regret.</p>
<p>Meantime my own love, I determined, must be a silent and
unsuspected one.</p>
<p>And so, when I met her the day after, I told her frankly of
all my love for Riverdale; how he and I had grown up together
with every thought <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>in common, how he had befriended me at school, and stood
by me at College, and how the first great grief of my life had
been our necessity of parting.</p>
<p>She was pleased, I could see, with all my praise of him;
pleased too, I thought, that we had discovered this new bond of
sympathy between us, and could discuss his career with a mutual
interest in his success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what it was,&rdquo; she said one day,
&ldquo;that brought you and Eric so closely
together,&rdquo;&mdash;thereby reproducing the very difficulty
that had often puzzled me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your natures are about as
far removed as the Antipodes.&nbsp; Unless I&rsquo;m much
mistaken, yours is a strong and uncommonly decided character,
with the most practical ideas of what life&rsquo;s work should
be.&nbsp; While he is a dear old indolent dreamer, with all the
fascination of modern Alcibiades, but with none of the energy or
<a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>ambition
that characterised the splendid young Athenian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there you are wrong, believe me, and will have to
admit it before the world has grown much older.&nbsp; He has in
him all the fire of the true artist,&mdash;latent it may be for a
while.&nbsp; But sooner or later it&rsquo;s bound to come to the
fore.&nbsp; Even now he&rsquo;s seeing things on the continent
that will stimulate it into activity, and then he&rsquo;ll show
what&rsquo;s in him and surprise us all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had hardly entered upon this policy of masterly inactivity
before I was tempted to abandon it.&nbsp; On a hot afternoon
towards the end of June I was lazily whipping the Rectory stream
on the chance of a trout, when Marion came down to me from the
terrace, clad&mdash;or so it seemed to my uneducated
gaze&mdash;in a diaphanous cloud of palest lavender, and holding
in her hand an open letter.&nbsp; Then and there I became
faithless to my <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>conscience, for never had she appeared to me in prettier
guise.&nbsp; Her dress&mdash;and I always like those confections
of cloud-like tulle or gauze under whatever name they are
scientifically known&mdash;was in perfect harmony with the cool
green tints of the Rectory garden, while excitement, and she was
excited now, always showed her at her best.&nbsp; It called up
the tawny light that slept in her hazel eyes, and flushed the
paleness of her cheeks, while the faintest breath of a summer
wind saw its opportunity and played with the tangles of her ruddy
hair.</p>
<p>Surely, I thought, I&rsquo;m hypersensitive, even in respect
for a love that has such claims on me as Eric&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And
after all, a man owes a duty to himself no less than to his
friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good news!&rdquo; she cried, as she floated to me down
the steps.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m off to the archery f&ecirc;te,
and am late already.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t go without
telling <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>you that I&rsquo;d heard at last from Eric, and,
what&rsquo;s more, we shall see him soon.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been
through all the great galleries&mdash;Paris, Dresden, Florence,
and Madrid.&nbsp; Since then he has been studying hard at Rome in
one of the best studios.&nbsp; He says his master thinks a lot of
him, and will dismiss him soon as needing only practice and hard
work, which he can manage just as well in England as in
Rome.&nbsp; Meantime, he&rsquo;s having a really good time of it,
making excursions between whiles to all the old towns, and
especially to Aquila and the Abruzzi, where every step an artist
takes gives him a fresh subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must be off now,&rdquo; she ran on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Goodbye; I wish you were coming to the f&ecirc;te.&nbsp;
But perhaps you are well out of it&mdash;(I thought the
reverse)&mdash;for I know you don&rsquo;t like archery.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s too statuesque and Apollo-like for you&mdash;would
suit Eric better, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; You would like <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>something a
little more real and murderous.&nbsp; By the way, I wonder you
didn&rsquo;t make a soldier of yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left me almost bewildered by her beauty.&nbsp; And, like a
true lover, I abandoned the Rectory trout to their own devices,
while I mused and dreamed over my lady&rsquo;s perfections.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;Shakespeare is
right, as he always is.&nbsp; Fancy <i>is</i> engendered in the
eye; at least it was in my case; born before I had seen any
reasons for its birth, in fact, in spite of many reasons to the
contrary, as I recalled the well-remembered shock of
Reggie&rsquo;s love-scene.&nbsp; And it may either die in its
cradle, or else turn to love, as mine did.&nbsp; Then how is it
that the unattractive women find their husbands?&nbsp; I suppose
there must be men to whom plainness, and even ugliness, can
appear perfection.&nbsp; The answer is not forthcoming, and I
give it up.&nbsp; At any rate, love&rsquo;s a phase of <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>feeling and
an emotion (often untrue and misleading, by the way), not a
deduction or an inference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then a trout took my fly, and I left off dreaming dreams
and landed it.</p>
<p>But her news had left me in a happier frame of mind, and I was
already beginning to look forward to Eric&rsquo;s arrival with a
wistful eagerness, as certain to determine, in one direction or
the other, this wearing period of anxiety and doubt.&nbsp; As a
matter of fact, the issue was nearer than I anticipated, and
events that followed rapidly had practically settled the decision
before he came.</p>
<h2><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> now been some months with Mr.
Richardson, and had gained a closer acquaintance with his methods
and means of influence.&nbsp; To all sinners and backsliders who
admitted their frailties he was lenity itself; albeit the sworn
enemy, by instinct and persuasion, of those prim respectabilities
who never do a wrong thing or (worse still in his eyes) never a
foolish one.</p>
<p>For example.&nbsp; To a lad who had lapsed into <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>vice with the
hot-headedness of youth, he was a kindly adviser; but hard as the
nether millstone to the lad&rsquo;s father, when he found he had
ejected the prodigal from house and home, and then taken credit
to himself for having re-adjusted his household with the wisdom
of Solomon.</p>
<p>Of his boldness in dealing with the difficulties of his creed,
I had a notable experience in the summer days that were with
us.</p>
<p>The evening was an exceptionally warm one, and he and I were
lingering till late on the terrace, watching them carry the last
loads of hay from the glebe that lay beyond the Rectory
stream.&nbsp; Everyone was working his hardest, for it was clear
to the least experienced eye that the fine weather was nearing
its end.&nbsp; Thick rain clouds were gathering in the west, and
occasionally dull muffled roars, heralded by distant flashes, ran
round us on the level of the horizon.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>The
Rector, I thought, looked perturbed and anxious.&nbsp; At last he
spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I detest more than I can say that new machine
which my tenant has introduced this year.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
pointed to what looked like a threshing-machine that was piling
the hay from a huge elevator on to the rick.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course it saves labour, but I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s most
horribly dangerous.&nbsp; It gives the men not a moment of peace
to secure their footing, which is never too safe.&nbsp; If they
stop for an instant, their work overpowers them.&nbsp; And what
with the dust and the noise, and the hay-cloud in which they are
buried, I wonder we&rsquo;ve got along so far without an
accident.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t fair to ask a man to work under
such conditions.&nbsp; Of course with a threshing-machine
it&rsquo;s different.&nbsp; The straw delivers itself slowly,
giving the men time to place and arrange it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All at once, and even as he was speaking, the <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>din was
suddenly hushed by the stoppage of the engine, and a silence, all
the more palpable for the tumult that preceded it, fell on the
crowd of busy workers.</p>
<p>The scene of intense unresting energy had been transformed in
a moment into a still picture of arrested life.&nbsp; Like
figures that the wand of some Arabian magician had charmed into
statues, each labourer stood rigid at his post, except in the
immediate neighbourhood of the rick where the nearest of them had
gathered and closed round something that lay prone and motionless
on the ground.&nbsp; Only the voice of the engine was heard
through the stillness, where it stood panting under a full head
of steam, as if in protest against the indignity which had so
abruptly arrested its forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of what I feared,&rdquo; said the Rector, who
was already leaving my side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray God not <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>the
worst.&nbsp; Will you wait for me here?&nbsp; Later on you may be
able to help me.&nbsp; But for the moment I had better go to them
alone.&nbsp; As yet, you see, you are a stranger among us, but
one, I am sure, who will soon be a friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The only son of his mother, and she was a
widow,&rsquo;&rdquo; I heard him whispering on his return,
&ldquo;and, what is more, the best of sons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Harry Hayman,&rdquo; he added aloud, &ldquo;the
lad I loved most in all the village, a splendid type of what is
noblest and manliest in our country rustics.&nbsp; And the
accident has happened precisely as I had expected.&nbsp; The boy
had his station at the edge of the rick where the pressure is
keenest and most dangerous, and at the last it overpowered
him.&nbsp; He had called to them&mdash;just one minute too late,
and I&rsquo;m afraid in angry words&mdash;to stop the
engine.&nbsp; Another victim to the press and hurry of existence,
which counts a life well lost to save a <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>load of
hay.&nbsp; But you and I must see what comfort we can give to his
mother.&nbsp; Thank Heaven, he was a good and blameless lad, and
&lsquo;as the tree falls there it lies,&rsquo; which means, I
take it, nothing more than that death has worked no violent
change on him, and that he has started anew with what advantage
he had gained from a useful and unselfish life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cottage for which we were bound stood at the edge of the
village, midway between the Rectory garden and the scene of the
accident.&nbsp; And as we crossed the Rectory bridge,
intermittent flashes from the clouds that had gathered overhead
threw into strong relief the half-completed rick, the engine that
still sent upwards a thin thread of smoke, with the gaunt
elevator at its side, out of which the wind flung casual wisps of
hay, as if in futile effort to continue its arrested task.</p>
<p>The shadow of the accident was full upon us, <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>and when the
door of the cottage was opened I expected to see a woman bowed
and overwhelmed with grief for a loss that had left her desolate
indeed.</p>
<p>What I saw in reality was a stern hard-visaged woman, who met
us with a clear unflinching gaze, suggesting a spirit that was up
in arms against fate, and with no thought left in her for
mourning or for tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you be come, passon,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;though &rsquo;tis little help you can give me, I
allow.&nbsp; Kind and true-hearted you be to us all, and well
enough we knows it.&nbsp; But even you can&rsquo;t tell us,
wi&rsquo; all your new-fangled notions, that the soul which
passes to its God wi&rsquo; a curse upon its lips shall be saved
in the Day of Judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first and only time I was to see the Rector
angry&mdash;angry and yet &lsquo;sinning not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the wickedness is
yours,&rdquo; <a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
86</span>and his voice was hard and stern.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay your
words before you utter that of which all the life that is left
you will be too little for repentance.&nbsp; Have you no greater
faith in God&rsquo;s love and mercy than in your own?&nbsp;
Nay&mdash;less, far less, for even you would have pardoned
him.&nbsp; An angry word, that dropt from him in great stress of
terror and excitement&mdash;is that to weigh against the record
of a life that was a model to all of us in brave unselfish
effort?&nbsp; And, remember, he has left his good name in your
keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confess that I thought him hard and unfeeling, hard almost
to cruelty.&nbsp; But he knew&mdash;none better&mdash;the
requirements of the case, and that it is worse than useless to
treat with salves a wound that needs the knife.</p>
<p>At the door he turned and said, &ldquo;I will try and do for
you what Harry would have wished, and what he so well
began.&nbsp; The lodge at the Manor <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>House is vacant, and I think I can
promise you the post.&nbsp; But never forget that it is for
Harry&rsquo;s sake I give it you&mdash;the lad I loved and valued
most in all the parish.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> same night the change we had
been expecting came on us, and a storm raged furiously till the
dawn.&nbsp; Sometimes, but very occasionally, a summer gale will
carry as much weight in it as one of its winter brethren.&nbsp;
And, when this is so, it works far wider damage both by sea and
land.&nbsp; It will catch our seamen, unprepared and
unsuspecting, on a lee shore of dangerous approach, with some
headland or cape to windward that bars their only path to
safety.</p>
<p>Less dangerous it may be to dwellers on the shore, but not
less dreaded.&nbsp; For it destroys, <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>almost in a moment, the wealth of
emerald foliage which Nature in her thriftiness had meant to last
for six long months, to perish gradually in greater glory still
of gold and scarlet, orange and russet-brown.&nbsp; And then one
morning she wakes to find her handiwork destroyed, at a time when
it is just too late for her to repair the damage.&nbsp; Nothing
left of all she has been secretly and silently creating through
the long months of winter, except a few torn and tattered leaves,
which she will make all speed she can to discard, seeing that
theirs can only be a discredited old age of uniform withered
brown.</p>
<p>It was over a foreground like this that I looked seawards that
morning.</p>
<p>Under my bedroom window two men were talking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Aye, she&rsquo;s done for,&rdquo; said one of them;
&ldquo;it won&rsquo;t be more than half-an-hour before she
strikes.&nbsp; With only a rag of canvas upon her, and one of her
masts gone, he&rsquo;d better give it up and <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>put her on
shore as soon as he can find a quiet place.&nbsp; Though, for the
matter of that, one place is no better than another, so far as
their chance of saving her goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; his
neighbour answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see he&rsquo;s
trying to push her along just outside the breakers till he can
bring her about opposite the coastguard station, and then
he&rsquo;ll shove her on shore.&nbsp; I can see them watching and
waiting for her; and they&rsquo;ve got the rockets ready on the
beach.&rdquo;&nbsp; And they moved off quickly in the direction
of their gaze.</p>
<p>Long before our party, which included the Squire and Marion,
had reached the scene of the disaster, the busiest part of the
proceedings was over.&nbsp; When she first struck, a heavy sea
had canted her round and laid her broadside to the shore, where
she lay, heaving and groaning like some living creature, under
the weight of the seas <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>as they struck her and then flung
themselves over her in sheets of foam.</p>
<p>A rocket had carried a guiding rope well across the wreck and
into the hands of the crew.&nbsp; Having secured it to the one
remaining mast, they had attached the travelling cradle, and, as
we came upon the scene, were one by one escaping to the
shore.</p>
<p>Not a minute too soon.&nbsp; For the seas were growing heavier
with the rising of the tide, and as each one struck her, the ship
shuddered through all her length, while jets of foam that burst
up through her decks showed that her timbers were yielding to the
strain.&nbsp; Even as we stood watching her she rose on the top
of a huge breaker, and, as she settled down again upon the
bottom, her sole remaining mast cracked and fell, and with it
went the rope and cradle that had wrought the safety of the
crew.</p>
<p><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>Another
moment, and, above the rush of wind and water, the plaintive howl
of a dog reached us from the deck.&nbsp; A large black retriever
had been fastened to the mast, and in the hurry and confusion of
their own escape the crew had forgotten to loose him.&nbsp; He
had waited most patiently, poor beast, while the crew were saving
themselves, waited in the belief that his own turn would come at
last.&nbsp; And all the while he had never uttered a sound,
though the seas that swept over the wreck must almost have
drowned or strangled him.</p>
<p>But now that he felt he was abandoned by the crew, fear had
fallen on him, which became panic when the mast to which he was
tethered crashed down at his side, leaving only the stump
standing to which he had been chained.&nbsp; We could see him
struggling violently as the seas swept over him, while now and
again he uttered a piteous howl, looking appealingly landwards as
if to call attention <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>to his despair.&nbsp; His terror
wrought painfully on all our hearts.&nbsp; It was no sight for a
woman to see, and I shuddered to think that Marion was there to
see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s too cruel,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will no one, no one save him?&nbsp; I would give anything
to see him safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything? really <i>anything</i>?&rdquo; I asked,
bending my head to hers, for the roar of wind and water made
speech and hearing difficult.</p>
<p>She looked me steadily in the face, as if trying to read my
meaning in my eyes.&nbsp; And then her own eyes fell before
mine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, anything,&rdquo; she said, and the word
came to me like an echo of the question I had asked her,
&ldquo;anything that friend may claim and I can give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It may be that her answer determined me though I think I
should have tried it, even without the incentive she had
given.&nbsp; It was intolerable to <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>see the poor brute drowning before
our eyes without an effort being made to save him, especially
when he had faced the danger so bravely, while he had watched us
rescuing the crew and felt there was still a chance for him of
life.&nbsp; Only, if it was to be done at all, I saw it must be
quickly done.&nbsp; Each sea as it came in was higher than the
last, and a seam that had opened in her side towards us showed us
that the ship was going fast.</p>
<p>My only chance, I saw, was to follow a spent wave and gain the
deck if possible before the next one broke on her.&nbsp; It was
all in my favour that she lay broadside to the shore, for her
bulk acted as a breakwater against the sea, making it fairly calm
water on the side of her that faced us.&nbsp; This would save me,
I saw, from the worst danger of all, that of being carried out to
sea by the retreating wave, though it brought with it another and
almost graver peril in the risk that I might be <a
name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>caught and
crushed against her side by the force of its retreat.</p>
<p>In any case now, if ever, my muscular training must stand me
in good stead.&nbsp; First of all I wound a rope about me,
leaving the shore-end of it in the hands of the coastguards, as I
relied on their help to ensure my safety in case I should be
overpowered by the rush of the retiring wave.&nbsp; Then I
watched and waited my time while one, two, three seas broke over
her; but none of them retreated far enough to serve my
purpose.&nbsp; The fourth was the heaviest of all, and when it
had spent itself, retreated further in proportion.&nbsp; Seizing
the opportunity, I dashed through the lake of foam that lay
between us and the wreck, and, grasping a rope that hung adrift
over her side, and which I had long marked as my one hope on the
chance of its being well secured at the further end, I swung
myself by means of it up and on to the deck.</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>Only
just in time; for as I landed on the deck a plank broke loose at
my feet, through which I saw that her whole side seawards was
gone, and that the cargo had nearly all washed out of her.&nbsp;
The next blow, I saw, would finish her.&nbsp; So, loosing the dog
and dropping him over the side, I hung for a moment while the
wave surged round me before I lowered myself.&nbsp; And on the
calm that followed the wave&rsquo;s retreat the watchers drew me
to the shore.&nbsp; And then, with a crash that echoed high above
the storm, she parted amidships, and the sea poured in volumes
through the rent in the severed hull.</p>
<p>I walked straight to the place where Marion was sitting with
the dog at her feet.</p>
<p>A word of thanks&mdash;no more.&nbsp; But it satisfied me, for
a light had sprung into her eyes that told me I had won her
love.</p>
<h2><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Peggy</span> had come to my study in sore
dismay.</p>
<p>There was to be a break and interlude, it seemed, in the
monotony of our household arrangements, which, for myself, I was
inclined to welcome.&nbsp; Peggy, however, regarded it with
extreme displeasure, not unmixed with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, sir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis Miss
Gertie&rsquo;s birthday next Tuesday, and the Rectory&rsquo;s to
be full of the visitors they&rsquo;ve invited to come for
it.&nbsp; Now, you&rsquo;d think that woman Josephine would know
better,&rdquo;&mdash;Peggy always had a shy shot at <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Josephine
whom she detested as a foreigner and interloper&mdash;&ldquo;but
no, not she.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s chosen this very time to invite
her brother&mdash;I hope he <i>is</i> her brother&mdash;no doubt
because she thinks it will be fine and lively for him with all
these rejoicings.&nbsp; And as they can&rsquo;t find room for him
at the Rectory, what does my lady do but coolly propose that you
and I should take him in?&nbsp; Now, if he were a healthy honest
Englishman I wouldn&rsquo;t mind.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t abide
these foreigners who wont trouble to talk our
language,&rdquo;&mdash;Peggy always premised that to speak
English by intuition was the birthright of every baby both at
home and abroad&mdash;&ldquo;and who live on toads and snails so
that one don&rsquo;t know how to cook for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, my dear Peggy, don&rsquo;t worry yourself and me;
I&rsquo;m just in the middle of my sermon.&nbsp; Let him come by
all means.&nbsp; I know a smattering of French, and shall be
rather glad of a chance of <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>improving my accent.&nbsp; Besides,
I&rsquo;ll order the dinners and take all the responsibility off
your hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; Never was heavy charge undertaken with
so light a heart.</p>
<p>So Peggy retired, muttering her discontent in the little
querulous tones, that, as usual, reminded me of a squirrel when
it finds that it has been robbed of its hoard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best; I can no more; but I&rsquo;m not
going to cook frogs and snails for any foreigner,&rdquo; was what
I heard more and more faintly as her voice receded to the
kitchen.</p>
<p>In one respect, at any rate, Peggy was hopelessly
astray.&nbsp; Josephine&rsquo;s friend was an American, and came
from Chicago, so that the hopes I had formed of furbishing up my
French were doomed to disappointment.&nbsp; It was in a dialect
which suggested no possible connection with the French that he
opened the conversation immediately on his arrival.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what &lsquo;tucker&rsquo; you
give me, only I must have cereals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he began.</p>
<p>In my ignorance I read the word &ldquo;serials,&rdquo; and
imagined that what he wanted was intellectual nourishment while
he dined, so I promptly offered him the choice between
&ldquo;Pearson&rsquo;s&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Strand.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;he wishes to study the
statistics&mdash;amply supplied by these periodicals&mdash;of how
large an animal would be forthcoming if all the oxen consumed by
England in a year were rolled into one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he wanted nothing of the kind.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is
absurd,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the way you Britishers tamper with
your digestions, filling yourselves with heavy, heating food,
when all that nature requires is corn and oil and wine&mdash;and
the less of the latter the better,&rdquo; he added as an
after-thought.</p>
<p>I cordially acquiesced, for he was not a man, I <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>saw, to
stand contradiction in any form.&nbsp; But all the while I was
troubling myself anent the dinner I had in store for him.</p>
<p>He had arrived late in the afternoon, and in my innocence I
had ordered for him a typical English repast&mdash;soup, roast
beef, and a &lsquo;fondu&rsquo; of cheese.</p>
<p>He waved the soup aside impatiently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
touch soup,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it interferes with my
digestion.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the same with the roast
beef.&nbsp; But the Yorkshire pudding saved me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can eat the fat of the beef,&rdquo; he said
condescendingly&mdash;&ldquo;spread on the pudding, it is highly
digestible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich,&rdquo; I thought, &ldquo;much too rich for the
ordinary stomach.&rdquo;&nbsp; But I resigned it to him
willingly, yes, all of it&mdash;and it was a remarkably fat
sirloin&mdash;if only because my own inclination did not lie that
way.&nbsp; So we got on well for the first day.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>But I
still had something to learn.&nbsp; I had no idea that
&ldquo;cereals&rdquo; comprehended the be-all and end-all of his
dietary.&nbsp; So I thought to tempt him with what was really a
very delicate menu.</p>
<p>A clear soup, red mullet, ptarmigan, with a savoury to follow,
was the not un-appetising fare I set before him.</p>
<p>The soup he declined as before, with the air of one who
refuses to re-open a question.</p>
<p>When the mullet followed I felt sure of his approval.&nbsp;
Not the veriest epicure could have resisted the tempting aroma
and the sight of the nut-brown envelopes which enshrouded the
&ldquo;woodcock of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This fish has not been cleaned,&rdquo; was the objection;
&ldquo;how careless of your cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course this criticism put him outside the pale.&nbsp; A man
who would clean a red mullet would <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>reject the soft roe of a herring or
(on occasion) murder his mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; he repeated&mdash;this time a
little angrily&mdash;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t dine without
cereals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My heart sank within me but I said with assumed confidence,
&ldquo;The cereals will follow later on.&nbsp; You see we
outsiders like something a little more solid to begin
with.&rdquo;&nbsp; But my bravery was all on the surface.&nbsp;
For how was he to sustain nature on one small savoury, even if he
sampled the whole of it?&nbsp; If only I had ordered Peggy to
supply the ample rice pudding or elegant dumplings of nursery
tradition!&nbsp; But it was too late now, for the ptarmigan was
already on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, no greens?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;broccoli, or
beans, or at any rate cabbage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I represented to him with deference that none of these
dainties were regarded by epicures as the natural concomitants of
ptarmigan.</p>
<p><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&ldquo;More of your silly English customs,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;to reject simple nourishing food, and heat the blood
with these unnatural kickshaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon a happy thought struck me, and I commandeered from
the kitchen the vegetables which I knew were even then simmering
to perfection for Peggy&rsquo;s supper.&nbsp; A noble broccoli
was the result&mdash;the very largest I ever saw&mdash;and
reposing on the very largest dish.&nbsp; How his eyes
glistened!&nbsp; It was transferred bodily to his plate, and,
drenched in a bottle of salad oil, was, he admitted, no bad
substitute for the &ldquo;cereals&rdquo; of commerce.</p>
<p>Again I followed up my fortunate idea, and defrauded Peggy of
five noble apple dumplings, four of which he accounted for on the
spot, and begged (with a smile of repletion which comforted me
exceedingly) that the remaining one might be reserved to furnish
forth his breakfast <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>table before he went his way in the
morning.&nbsp; But the attempt to reorganise my kitchen on a
system to suit his digestion proved too heavy a problem for Peggy
and me.&nbsp; So for the remainder of his visit he and I went our
separate ways, as far as the meals were concerned.&nbsp; At
dinner he seemed happy with vegetables and puddings, and for the
rest of the day he drank tea unlimited, and refreshed himself at
intervals with apples, bananas, nuts and cakes, with which I was
careful to garnish the sideboard during the remainder of his
stay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monkey Brand,&rdquo; I called him, and he did
not resent the title, &ldquo;being proud,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;to resemble his ancestors.&rdquo;&nbsp; For he was a
kindly genial fellow, and never took a joke amiss.</p>
<p>Indeed, his simplicity and cheeriness quite won my heart, and
reconciled me almost to the trouble of catering for him.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>But
Peggy was far less amenable, and never became tolerant of his
ways.&nbsp; I believe she persuaded herself to the end that he
was a Frenchman, who for some evil purpose was masquerading as an
American, and pretended, from sheer &lsquo;contrariness&rsquo; or
worse, to have forgotten his mother-tongue.</p>

107</span>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Gertie&rsquo;s birthday at
the Rectory, and there was a sound of merry-making in the air,
but what form it would take was held a secret from all of us who
were not required to take an active part in its
celebration.&nbsp; Only I saw great signs of preparation in
progress both at the Rectory and the Manor House.&nbsp;
Peggy&rsquo;s aid was called in to help in the cutting and sewing
of many mysterious garments.&nbsp; Music, too, I saw was to be
held in requisition, for there was a sound of constant rehearsals
in the Rectory and Manor House drawing-rooms.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>But
what puzzled me most was the refurbishing of an enormous array of
old lanterns&mdash;not adapted to illumination or calculated to
add lustre to the festivities of the day.&nbsp; No; lanterns
these of a past and antiquated type, resembling in some degree
the lanterns of horn which, as illuminators, have long ago passed
out of fashion, and are only to be found occasionally in some
stable or cowshed that has lapsed far behind the progress of the
age.</p>
<p>Never did I imagine that female tongues&mdash;girlish tongues
more especially&mdash;could keep a secret so rigidly.&nbsp; Not a
word was let slip by Marion or the Rectory party in explanation
of their proceedings, so all I could do was to possess my soul in
patience, thankful that my own presence was not a necessary part
in the due performance of these mysteries.</p>
<p>I have told you, I think, something of the <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>position of
the Manor House.&nbsp; But of its greatest, and perhaps unique
attraction, I have said nothing.&nbsp; In olden times a monastery
of large dimensions had held possession of the ground that lay
between the Manor House and the Rectory.&nbsp; Of this the
Refectory was the only perfect fragment, a magnificent vaulted
building just visible from the Manor House windows where it lay
in the valley beneath.&nbsp; Built of some fine grey stone that
had taken to itself all the colouring of which lichens are
capable, it was tinted now with soft-toned yellows in every
possible gradation, and, in the sunlight of an autumn evening,
literally glowed in the warmth of the reflected rays.&nbsp; Only
a barn now, and the labourers who went in and out of it, to store
and stack the produce of the glebe, never bethought themselves of
the glory from which it had fallen.</p>
<p>The river that brought us the Rectory trout <a
name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>lower down
in its course had been arrested on its way by the monks, and
formed a lake, with a tree-clad island in the midst, from which
they supplied themselves with Lenten fare.&nbsp; On the ground
that rose between the lake and the Manor, scattered fragments of
ruins&mdash;here an unsupported arch, hard by a standing column
or fragment of wall&mdash;with sarcophagi, at intervals, that had
been removed from their niches and desecrated of their contents,
all testified to the power and wide extent of the original
community.&nbsp; These ruins lay within the precincts of the
Manor House.&nbsp; But just outside the boundary, on the summit
of an adjoining hill, there rose into the thin air the wondrous
shape of a tiny chapel, beside the perfection of which even the
Refectory itself looked coarse and material.&nbsp; Coloured by a
growth of lichen of the same soft tones, and with all its
delicate tracery untouched by the lapse of some five hundred <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>years, it
seemed the product of some fairy hand.&nbsp; But the hand must
have known its business well, for, in spite of the delicate
workmanship, every needless point and pinnacle had been rigidly
cut down, that the gales which fell full upon it from the broad
Atlantic might find no grip or holding ground.&nbsp; Even the
buttresses and gargoyles had been allowed no useless
ornamentation or finish; all the adornment had wisely been
lavished on the interior.&nbsp; It had been fashioned in one
single nave, and the fans which sprang from the columns on either
side gave a lightness and delicacy to the roof that minuter
decoration would have only impaired, while a tiny tower, uprising
at the end that over-looked the sea and pierced by a narrow
winding stair, supplied just what was needed to break the
monotony of the exterior outline.</p>
<p>It was to this wondrous place, I found, that the birthday
festivities were directed.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>As
evening approached, all who were to take part in the ceremonial
assembled at the Refectory.&nbsp; In what took place within, no
outsider was allowed to participate.&nbsp; But at eight
o&rsquo;clock, and just as the moon was rising, a long procession
of robed and cowled monks issued from the building, and holding,
each of them, a lantern in his hand, entered on the slow and
winding ascent that led to the chapel on the hill.&nbsp; And as
they wended their way round and round the grass-clad cone, their
voices came to us in slow and solemn hymns for the sailors on the
sea.&nbsp; The course of time had been reversed, and once again,
as in the days when the chapel was built, we saw re-enacted
before us the ritual for which it was intended.&nbsp; It was
difficult even for ourselves, who knew well and intimately every
one of those cowled monks, to believe that we were not living
five centuries before our time, and assisting once again in a <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>ceremonial
that, in the early days of the monastery, must have taken place
again and again when storm and tempest were raging.&nbsp; Only
to-night there was no storm and tempest.&nbsp; The necessities of
modern comfort and convention had so far interfered with the
celebration, that it was re-enacted at a time when the chief
requirements for its enactment were obtrusively wanting.&nbsp;
And when the summit of the hill had been reached, we watched and
waited till the final development came.</p>
<p>On a sudden from the tower that crowned the chapel a light
flashed out and burned steadily from a brazier on its
summit.&nbsp; Any sailors who were voyaging along that calm and
moonlit sea must have been startled by a light that warned them
they were approaching a rough and inhospitable coast, of which,
in a brightness that was clear as the day, no ship could by any
possibility have <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>been ignorant, unless the look-out had been hopelessly
and disgracefully incapable.</p>
<p>The light burned on for an hour, then vanished.</p>
<p>And the festivities of Gertie&rsquo;s birthday were ended.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>I was beginning to descend the hill among the more belated of
the revellers, when a gentle hand was laid on my shoulder, and I
turned and saw Marion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking everywhere for you,
Harold,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but in all the crowd and
confusion you were undiscoverable.&nbsp; Birthday festivities for
Gertie, and birthday festivities for you and me, dear&mdash;the
birthday of our love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then we dropped purposely behind the crowd, who were
sweeping in all directions down the hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go back to the chapel, Harold,&rdquo; she <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We may never see the view on
such a night again.&nbsp; Even the tropics couldn&rsquo;t supply
a scene to smile more sweetly on our love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, that they couldn&rsquo;t, dearest.&nbsp; What is it
the poet says?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Come away! the heavens above<br />
Just have light enough for love.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the heavens have been kinder still to you and me,
Marion, and lighted us a lamp by which I can read every glance in
your eye, and every smile on your lips.&nbsp; And are you really
happy, dear, I wonder?&nbsp; I can never hear you say it too
often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Harold, happy as I never expected or deserved to
be.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she would say no more&mdash;only drew
closer to my side&mdash;for she was new and strange to the
expression of her love.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you wonder how they got up the
turret-stairs to light the lamp?&nbsp; <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>I&rsquo;ve
tried them again and again and could never manage more than half
of them, even in the daylight.&nbsp; Many of them are gone
altogether, and all of them are crumbling and
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that was part of the secret, dear, they kept so
well, though I thought that you at any rate had been entrusted
with it.&nbsp; The girls, you see, wanted a man to manage that
for them, and so they condescended to trust me with the
business.&nbsp; There have been carpenters at work in the tower
for days, but always in the late evening and when no one was
about.&nbsp; And they&rsquo;ve made quite a decent flight of
wooden steps.&nbsp; Suppose we try them.&nbsp; The view from the
top will be finer even than this; and, better still, we shall be
alone together for once in the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We did well to climb the turret, for the panorama all around
us was clear as on the clearest day.</p>
<p>The chapel hill, on which we stood, rose from <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>the centre
of a valley which was itself encompassed by a ring of distant
hills, except on the side towards the sea, on which two or three
small steamers were passing, like flies across a silver
shield.</p>
<p>All the deep places of the valley were shrouded in a moonlit
mist.&nbsp; Only here and there a tree-top, or some ruined
fragment of the monastery beneath, rose high enough to pierce the
silver cloud.&nbsp; In the distance the hills shone bright and
clear, their smooth and regular outline broken at intervals by
rounded tumuli, fit emblems of the Mighty Mother who had taken
her children back again to her bosom for their last sleep.</p>
<p>On the velvet sward below us lay the form of another chapel,
designed, or so it might have seemed, in ebony or jet.&nbsp; So
black and well-defined was the shadow that it seemed more real
and substantial than the fabric on which we stood.&nbsp; Each
point and parapet of the building was reproduced <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>in clearest
silhouette, even to the outline of the hideous gargoyles, of
which our own two figures where we leaned upon the parapet might
have been modern imitations in a less outlandish form.</p>
<p>At our feet stood the brazier, its weird and slender form
reprinted on the platform of the tower, wherein a few live coals,
remnant of the spent beacon-fire, still showed a dull and lurid
glare.&nbsp; In the moonlight they shone like coloured fruits
piled in a basket of ribbed and frosted silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be the tripod of the Delphic shrine,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;ready prepared for some solemn incantation.&nbsp;
Suppose we try its efficacy, Marion, by swearing fealty to our
love.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, with only the solemn hills around us
and the silence of the moonlit night, my love and I crossed hands
above the glowing embers and prayed that the flame of <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>our love
might burn undimmed till the change which men call death should
renew it in another and more perfect form.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Love&rsquo;s pious flame for ever
burneth;<br />
From Heaven it came, to Heaven returneth,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>quoted Marion, &ldquo;which is true enough, though Southey was
no poet; else he&rsquo;d have put such a pretty idea in more
poetic form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how you came to love me, Marion,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;especially as I am sure that Eric was my
rival.&nbsp; And you know I&rsquo;m nothing to him in looks or
prospects or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, fishing for compliments already, are you?&nbsp;
Though perhaps it&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a dear old
fellow and I love him almost as much as I do you.&nbsp; Only, you
see, in another way.&nbsp; And perhaps for a husband one wants
something to lean upon&mdash;something more manly, it may be, and
less picturesque.&nbsp; You aren&rsquo;t offended, are you, by
the <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>implied compliment?&nbsp; And there was the wreck, and
that settled it.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t give me a chance.&nbsp;
Why, I never look at Bruno,&rdquo;&mdash;this was the name of the
dog, for the captain had given him to her&mdash;&ldquo;without
thinking how you risked your life to please my idle fancy.&nbsp;
Though indeed it was no fancy, for I should always have been
dreaming of him if that poor dog had died.&nbsp; And yet,
perhaps&mdash;<i>perhaps</i>&mdash;I cannot tell.&nbsp; Sometimes
I think I might have ended by marrying Eric, if you had stayed
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footstep sounded on the platform behind us, and there,
confronting us as we turned to go, stood Riverdale himself.&nbsp;
He had heard, I felt sure, Marion&rsquo;s concluding words.</p>
<h2><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">had</span> won my mistress, but my mind
misgave me that I had lost my friend.&nbsp; Not from any signs of
disappointment on his part, or any token that the world outside
us could have recognised.&nbsp; Even to myself, who had known his
innermost soul for years, there were times when I could cheat
myself into the belief that all was well between us.&nbsp; But,
just as there are times and seasons when Nature&rsquo;s face and
influence seem out of harmony with our mental and physical being,
even so, and quite as surely, it <a name="page122"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 122</span>was borne in upon me that his love
for me was gone.</p>
<p>He had taken the news of my engagement well&mdash;too well, or
so it seemed to me.</p>
<p>Perhaps the greatest charm of our friendship in the good old
days had been the thought that I, alone of all his friends, had
gained admission to his innermost heart.&nbsp; By all the rest of
the world his easy-going air of calm indifference had been
accepted for the reality.&nbsp; I alone knew what deep
intensities of passion burned beneath that calm exterior.</p>
<p>And this, I take it, is the very highest crown and glory of a
love&mdash;to feel that you alone have gained admission where no
one else may tread.</p>
<p>Now, something, an indefinite something, had come between
us.&nbsp; To all but me the change was impalpable; only, if
possible, an added charm and courtesy in his relations with
Marion and me.&nbsp; <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Nothing, I think, that she herself
could realise or detect, for his manner towards her had always
held in it a studied gentleness; only the gentleness was
accentuated now.</p>
<p>But between him and me the veil had fallen.&nbsp; To those who
did not know him, it would seem strange, no doubt, that Eric had
not long ago declared his love.&nbsp; That he had never done so,
I knew from Marion herself.&nbsp; Most affectionate, she said,
most devoted he had been; but never a word that bordered upon
love.&nbsp; At the last she had begun to doubt whether it really
existed at all, especially when his letters that reached her were
so few and silent on the subject.</p>
<p>But I, who knew him better than she did, saw in this very
self-restraint and reticence concerning his feelings only an
additional indication of their strength.&nbsp; His, I knew, was a
singularly proud temperament, that would never have ventured to
<a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>risk the
final issue till he had well assured himself that failure was
impossible.&nbsp; And for this assurance he had been
waiting&mdash;waiting through all his studentship at Rome, rarely
writing and never allowing an intimation of it to betray him in
his letters.&nbsp; Simply waiting, till the artist-fire within
him should have realised itself in action, and then offering his
first great picture, together with the gift of his love, at
Marion&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>And then, just when he had realised his heart&rsquo;s desire
of fame, and saw the world&rsquo;s honours placed within his
grasp, he had come home only to find that he had been forestalled
by me, and that he had lost beyond recall the greater prize of
Marion&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Truly a test that might imperil even
the friendship of a life.</p>
<p>I would have given much to prevent him, had it been possible,
from hearing Marion&rsquo;s last words on the chapel tower.&nbsp;
Not that I could blame <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>myself in any wise.&nbsp; I had
acted loyally to him throughout, and should have continued to do
so, had not Fate on a sudden taken the arbitrament into her own
hands, and left me no faintest loophole for deciding otherwise
than I did.&nbsp; But considering that I had satisfied my
conscience, I felt strangely disquieted by the result.&nbsp; Of
the reticence I had imposed on myself through long months, and of
my determination to await his return for the decision of the
issue, he could know nothing.&nbsp; And if he had gained the
faintest suspicion that I knew of his love, my action, I felt
sure, must wear the appearance of one who had been deliberately
working to supplant his friend; worse still, had precipitated the
issue so soon as the rumour was forthcoming of his probable
return.&nbsp; Worse, too, than all was the possibility that he
had heard nothing of my residence at Fleetwater or my growing
love for Marion.&nbsp; All this, though wholly <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>unavoidable, as I neither knew nor could discover his
address, must needs in his eye seem the very silence of
premeditation, which had been waiting to make the disclosure till
the result should be irremediable.</p>
<p>But if he had indeed heard our conversation, of which I could
feel no doubt, he never by a word alluded to it.&nbsp; With the
warmth with which we had parted, with the same he met me
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was glad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that his
two best friends were to be drawn closer to him still,&rdquo;
and, laughing in his old frank way, had added that &ldquo;we two
had not been long in discovering the affinity between
us.&rdquo;&nbsp; This faintest gleam of satire was the only
intimation he allowed himself of the feeling that lay buried in
his heart.</p>
<p>Eric had hurried his departure from Rome, because the summer
heat had set in earlier than usual that year, and because the
work still left for <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>him to do could be done equally well
at home as abroad.&nbsp; Then he entered with spirit into the
history of his travels.&nbsp; And how it was the Museum at
Madrid, and the work of Velasquez in particular, that had fired
his imagination and stimulated his activity to try and do
likewise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should just see his pictures,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and what that man can do.&nbsp; Why, his horses and riders
come galloping to you out of the canvas!&nbsp; Even that
scoundrel Philip II., perhaps the worst and basest coward that
ever lived in history, gains something of distinction and
nobility by the touch of his pencil.&nbsp; And he can paint you
an atmosphere and distance in which a man can breathe and
walk.&nbsp; And what does he do it all with?&nbsp; No flaming,
gorgeous colours like Titian&rsquo;s and Tintoret&rsquo;s, but
all in quiet greens and greys and browns that would be dull as
ditchwater in any other hand.&nbsp; Opinions, I know, differ, but
to me <a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>at
any rate he has always seemed the greatest of Art&rsquo;s great
Trinity&mdash;Titian, Rembrandt, and himself.&nbsp; And to him I
owe everything.&nbsp; He it was who read me the lesson that I
have tried to learn&mdash;to decide what I wanted to paint, and
then go straight for it, letting all the accessories and
inessentials come in at the end where they can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes; it was another and a different Eric who was talking to us
now from the one with whom I had parted nearly two years
ago.&nbsp; The indolent dreamer of those days had been
transfigured into the man with a purpose.&nbsp; And I hoped, as I
heard him, that he had made a mistress of his art, and might find
in his devotion to her the happiness which we are told she always
gives to those who worship her with a whole and undivided
purpose.</p>
<p>Three days later he left us, to finish, he told us, the first
great picture he had attempted.&nbsp; It was already too late for
the Academy, but competent <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>judges thought so highly of its
merits that he intended to risk its first appearance in the
almost fiercer light of a London show-room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of
course,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you two must be the first to see
it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the general chorus of
congratulation that welcomed our engagement I must include a
letter I received from my erstwhile rival, Reggie.&nbsp; We had
found time during his vacations to become fast friends, and he
wrote to me from my old rooms in Trinity, where, by some strange
freak of fortune, he was now installed.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Stirling,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you heartily on your engagement to
Marion, and think you lucky beyond the majority of mankind.&nbsp;
If I hadn&rsquo;t been her cousin, and much too infantine in
years, I <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>would have done my level best to supplant you.&nbsp;
Peggy, I fancy, would have co-operated with me, as I am sure she
believes even now that, if you had only gone the way of the other
curates and left me a fair field, I should have won easily in a
canter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not only do I congratulate you, but I also send you a
wedding-present, which is unlike ordinary presents of the kind in
that it will be valuable to you while it will cost me
nothing.&nbsp; In fact, I am only presenting to you what is
already your own property.&nbsp; The picture which I forward
herewith was found in the cupboard of your gyp-room.&nbsp; If age
is valuable as well as venerable, there is little doubt that I
have been happy in the choice of my wedding-present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will forgive me, I hope, for my unseasonable
jocularity.&nbsp; It is intended to comfort your heart by proving
to you that my youthful affections <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>have not been so seriously blighted
as at one time you had cause to imagine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours, without envy or uncharitableness,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Reggie</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;The young rascal,&rdquo; I muttered.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
must have known all the time&mdash;perhaps his sisters told
him&mdash;that I had been a witness of his youthful
escapade.&nbsp; Well, the lad&rsquo;s got a sense of humour in
him at any rate.&nbsp; But I wonder what picture he means?&nbsp;
Oh, no doubt it&rsquo;s the one that&rsquo;s been in our family
for a hundred years at least.&nbsp; My grandfather, I think it
was, brought it from Spain, and thought a lot of it too; though
why and wherefore, passes my comprehension.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s
certainly old and dirty enough, as Reggie says, to be
valuable.&nbsp; I was always intending to have it re-framed and
always forgot it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the picture arrived a day later, the first thing I did
was to carry out my intention of <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>having it cleaned and
re-framed.&nbsp; We had always supposed it to be the portrait of
some cardinal, a faint glow of red being the only colour that had
power in it to pierce the dirt of ages.</p>
<p>But now at last was revealed a face of marvellous beauty, and
(strange to say) of a pronounced English type.&nbsp; The pale
refined features and sunny hair resembled nothing that one
encounters among the native types of Italy and Spain.</p>
<p>I should have put him down from his dress as an acolyte or
choir boy, or, it might be, some cardinal&rsquo;s page.&nbsp; But
who he was, or how he found himself in Spain, or why he should
have clothed himself from head to foot in scarlet, even to his
very cap, it was beyond my power to fathom.&nbsp; It was a
remarkable coincidence, too, that he much reminded me of a famous
portrait by Bronzino that had taken my fancy at Madrid, in
connection with which I had been met years <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>before by
the self-same difficulty, when the official catalogue, so far as
I remembered, had been equally incompetent to solve it.</p>
<p>It was a mystery, furthermore, how my grandfather could have
secured so good a copy.&nbsp; For the possession of the finest
gallery in the world has never tempted the Spaniard of to-day to
cultivate art, nor has he established in his capital city a
community of copyists like that which flourishes at Rome.&nbsp;
With such fine traditions of painting to his credit, he is
therewith content, and a copy of real excellence, which this
undoubtedly was, would, I felt sure, be wholly beyond the range
of his capacity.</p>
<p>With the difficulties of the picture still unsolved, I
dismissed it from my thoughts, merely telling Peggy to hang it in
my sitting-room, where it would find itself in congenial harmony
with Eric&rsquo;s <i>Antinous</i>.&nbsp; Peggy, I could see,
resented its <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>introduction altogether, as savouring of Papistry and
the Scarlet Woman, and would have preferred to turn it with its
face to the wall; only I declined to consider her feelings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wonder what Eric would say of the picture?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll ask him some day,&rdquo; I said to Marion, who was in
raptures over the delicate beauty of the portrait.</p>
<p>My happiness during all this period, but for my anxiety about
Riverdale, would have been whole and unalloyed.&nbsp; No one was
more surprised than myself to find how many friends I had made
during my short residence at Fleetwater.&nbsp; Peggy was the only
one who held aloof and was chary of congratulation.</p>
<p>Naturally the Rectory girls were wild with delight.&nbsp;
Hardly had they recovered their equanimity after the excitement
of Gertie&rsquo;s birthday, when, lo and behold, they foresaw in
the near distance a vision of other and greater festivities <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>that
promised to outrival even the ceremonial on Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>From the first the Rector had shown himself a warm friend, and
whenever I was free of my duties in the parish, the chances were
you would have found me in his company, either helping him to
keep down the trout in the Rectory stream, or taking lessons from
him in gardening, whereat Marion and I formed the students of his
class.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No arrangement&mdash;none, Stirling,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;could have been more in accordance with my plans for the
future.&nbsp; So soon as I am too old for work&mdash;and
I&rsquo;ve had a twinge or two of gout already&mdash;you and
Marion will come to the Rectory, while I retire to a little
property lower down the river, where I&rsquo;ll catch all the
trout that you allow to escape you in their travels past the
garden.&nbsp; You know, of course, that the Park and Manor House
are strictly entailed, and will go to a distant <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>cousin.&nbsp; So, for the present, I shall consider
that I only hold the living in keeping for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Information privately received from Marion had left me in no
fear concerning the result of my proposed interview with the
Squire.&nbsp; From the first he had shown a warm liking for
me&mdash;all the warmer, perhaps, because I was staunch, from his
point of view, on the question of fox-hunting; thinking, as I
honestly did, that the Rector was hardly so fair as usual in his
denunciation of the sport.</p>
<p>I was to dine alone with him that evening, and when Marion had
left us to our wine he came at once to the subject.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am perfectly satisfied, Stirling,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;with Marion&rsquo;s choice.&nbsp; Personally I have a
strong liking for you, and have no ambition whatever that she
should make what is called a great marriage.&nbsp; Though I
honestly confess I am somewhat disappointed that she has <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>thrown over
Riverdale, who I am sure is devoted to her, and would infallibly
have proposed later on.&nbsp; Indeed, it&rsquo;s been a puzzle to
me and to all of us why he&rsquo;s held back so long.&nbsp;
However, all this is none of our business.&nbsp; I would never
prejudice a girl&rsquo;s inclination by so much as a word.&nbsp;
But, to speak candidly, I could not have given her to you or to
any man who had not a small fortune of his own to start
with.&nbsp; And this, not so much for her sake&mdash;she will
have enough and to spare&mdash;as her husband&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
There is nothing that places a man in a more false situation than
the fact of his being entirely dependent on his wife&rsquo;s
property.&nbsp; Indeed, no man of any spirit would accept the
position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is only one thing more, and then I will dismiss
you to join Marion in the drawing-room.&nbsp; To make your income
secure, I would suggest to you&mdash;simply as a
friend&mdash;that you remove the part of your capital which you
have in the bank&mdash;<a name="page139"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 139</span>these new concerns are none of them
too safe&mdash;and place it in some good security that can be
recognised by trustees.&nbsp; And now, for I know you are longing
to join Marion, I&rsquo;ll only say that I congratulate you on
your success as heartily as I congratulate myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the drawing-room Marion sang to me my favourite songs,
amongst them, of course, &lsquo;The Message&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Requital.&rsquo;&nbsp; Last of all I asked for &lsquo;My
Queen,&rsquo; the song which above all others realises the entire
self-abandonment which is the very hall-mark of love.&nbsp; For a
love that is true and worth the name will impose on itself no
restrictions and no limitations, giving itself wholly and
unreservedly, without asking the reason why and wherefore, to the
object of its worship.</p>
<p>And then we wandered out through the gardens and the park down
to the site of the monastery beyond, strolling in and out between
the ruined <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>walls and arches, while a nightingale, who night after
night gave a concert to his mate at the same hour from the same
tree, sang to us his own idea of love.</p>
<p>Not talking this time, either of us, as to the mysteries or
pleasures of a world to come&mdash;too happy, I am afraid, with
this one.&nbsp; And certainly dreaming nothing of a danger that
was already drawing nearer and still nearer with the intent to
wreck our happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the wreck still lay in
shattered fragments on the beach, and had brought discredit and
disaster to at least one family in the village before it
disappeared in another and still heavier gale.</p>
<p>It was the best-looking young woman in the parish and the
best-looking young man whom I had united to-day in the holy bond
of matrimony.&nbsp; And now the wedding-dance was being held in a
room twelve feet by twelve, while the wedding-feast of light
refreshments was spread in the wash-house adjoining.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Ned
Baker was a young fellow of the pale, refined type, looking
younger even than his years, and they numbered only
twenty-four&mdash;a type rarely met with in a country village,
with clean and well-cut features, light wavy hair, and the slim
hand and tapering fingers that one assigns to a musician, and
associates not at all with the rough training of a village
carpenter.&nbsp; More fitted, you would say, to stand behind a
London counter and minister yards of drapery to some west-end
beauty.&nbsp; Perhaps his refinement may have been partially due
to delicate health since boyhood; nothing serious his friends
would tell you, but just sufficient to unfit him for out-door
labour, and direct the tenor of his life to the comparative ease
of a carpenter&rsquo;s workshop.</p>
<p>His wife in all probability, judging from her appearance,
would rule the roost.&nbsp; A woman of the strong, well-bosomed
order, outcome oftener <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>of the village than the town, with
the wild westerly breezes and salt sea air of the Atlantic
mantling in her cheek.</p>
<p>Truth to say, Ned was hardly a popular inmate of what was now
his native village.&nbsp; In appearance and refinement he was far
above the tribe of fishermen who inhabited the scattered hamlet,
and won a precarious livelihood from fishing and
boating&mdash;sometimes, &rsquo;twas said, from the jetson cast
up by the sea beyond, when a wreck, such as still lay in
fragments not one hundred yards from their doors, would strew the
shore for miles and miles with drift of freight and timber.</p>
<p>It was natural, perhaps, that they should resent a superiority
which contrasted only too strongly with their own rough and
rugged natures.&nbsp; Besides, he was an alien&mdash;literally a
drift from the sea&mdash;cast up and laid for dead upon the sand
some twenty years ago.</p>
<p><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>No
one knew aught of him&mdash;he did not know anything of
himself&mdash;though his wavy sun-locks and bright blue eyes
might have proclaimed him of the north, the fragile incarnation
of some Viking of the past.&nbsp; But all was guess-work and
mystery, for he was a little lad of three years old when the sea
laid him at their doors, after claiming for its own the ship and
everything, dead or living, that it had carried for its
freight.</p>
<p>Kindly hands had welcomed him.&nbsp; An old fisherman and his
wife, without children or relations of their own, had loved and
cherished the boy to manhood.&nbsp; But they were dead and gone,
and for years since he had lived his life alone, till Arabella
Bond, the beauty of the village, had been won by the very grace
and refinement which had made him alien and outcast from the
other villagers.</p>
<p>Indeed, with the single exception of the couple who had reared
him, Arabella had been his first <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>and only friend.&nbsp; Three or four
years older than himself, she had, as a child, taken him under
her special protection, comforting him in all his troubles, and
waging incessant war with the lads of the village on his
behalf.&nbsp; Her strong motherly instincts, fired as time went
on by a warm passion of love, had gone out in pity to the youth
who had been flung, alien and isolated, among a world of
strangers.&nbsp; And her devotion never wavered.&nbsp; Even now
her feeling towards him was rather that of the mother than the
wife, and, but for her, his prayer would have been that the sea
might yet reclaim its gift of life.&nbsp; Nameless and unknown,
he was from the first an object of suspicion to the
villagers.&nbsp; Add to which, he had been cast up by the sea,
and the awe which clings round such a one, and the peril that it
foreshadows to his preservers, were for ever present in their
minds.</p>
<p>With a race of men animated by their traditions <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>King Arthur
himself, if he had been cast upon their shore, would never have
gained their confidence.&nbsp; And with Ned&rsquo;s growth in
years the feeling against him had only become stronger and more
accentuated.&nbsp; A high regard for honour&mdash;honour in every
word and deed&mdash;was the dominant characteristic of his life,
shown in nothing more conspicuously than in his scrupulous
honesty respecting all property recovered from the sea.&nbsp;
Such views were in hopeless antagonism to all the traditions of
the neighbourhood, where the villagers, whose ancestors may have
smuggled a little in the days gone by, held a rooted belief that
the sea was their property, placed where it was by a beneficent
Providence to afford them a livelihood, and sometimes, though not
half so often as they wished, to present them with an unearned
increment in the shape of a wreck and the perquisites that
followed from it.</p>
<p><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>And,
most unfortunately for Ned, no one held this faith with stronger
persistence than Arabella&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; To discover, if
possible, the owner of such property, or to report it to the
recognised authorities would have been judged by her a
superlative act of folly, a wanton flying in the face of
Providence, which sent them such windfalls, as it did the
mackerel and the herrings&mdash;only with less regularity.&nbsp;
It may be, I fancy, that the northern nations, from whom Ned
inherited his birthright, are as punctilious in the practice of
honour as southerners are in the profession of it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, Ned and his folly were perpetual irritants to
Arabella&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; And matters were in no wise
improved when he became a suitor for her daughter&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; Even his personal appearance and his love-locks,
&ldquo;clustering o&rsquo;er his fair forehead like a
girl&rsquo;s,&rdquo; came in for her abuse.&nbsp; &ldquo;A fine
gen&rsquo;elman you be,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;to teach <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>us all our
duties, and make out as how we be thieves an&rsquo; liars.&nbsp;
Why, you bain&rsquo;t no better nor a gal&mdash;an&rsquo; a poor
&rsquo;un at that&mdash;wi&rsquo; all your long hair
a-danglin&rsquo; about your forehead, an&rsquo; no strength in ye
to pull an oar or gi&rsquo; a hand to the fishin&rsquo;-tackle or
the lobster-pots.&nbsp; Blest if I can tell what Arabella sees in
ye.&nbsp; But there&mdash;there&rsquo;s no accountin&rsquo; for
tastes.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas sommat liker to a man that would
ha&rsquo; suited I, when I was lookin&rsquo; round me for a
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Arabella would heal the wound and say: &ldquo;Never
&rsquo;e mind, Ned.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis because ye be so much better
than they that they hates ye so cruel.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; yer fine
language and looks that shames &rsquo;em all every time they
meets ye, no wonder they can&rsquo;t stomach ye.&nbsp; Not but
what you be learnin&rsquo; a lot of our talk now along, and ye
clips yer words fine, same a&rsquo; most as we does.&nbsp; May be
they&rsquo;ll think the better of ye by and bye, when you gets a
bit <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>liker to &rsquo;em.&nbsp; Not that I wishes it, my
dear, never think it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t I that would have
loved ye so fondly if ye hadn&rsquo;t been better an&rsquo;
cleverer an&rsquo; handsomer than all the rest of
&rsquo;m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But to-day all past animosities were forgotten, and the
company who had been called to the festivities could only bethink
themselves of the arrangements provided for their comfort.</p>
<h2><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Tis</span> a rare sight
this, granfer, for a weddin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I only wish as how my
old mother what&rsquo;s bedridden upstairs&mdash;her&rsquo;s
ninety, come Thursday&mdash;could crawl down along and glad her
aged eyes wi&rsquo; it.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s more a&rsquo;most
than we can claim o&rsquo; the Almighty, seein&rsquo; she&rsquo;s
kept her bed now for nigh on five years.&nbsp; Not but what
she&rsquo;s rare and hearty still, and can eat her bread
an&rsquo; cheese and drain a pot of beer most as well as I
can.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a wonderful strong and lusty constitution,
to <i>be</i> sure.&nbsp; Her eyesight don&rsquo;t fail
her&mdash;only <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>her limbs ain&rsquo;t so strong as once they was.&nbsp;
And no wonder, what wi&rsquo; lyin&rsquo; a-bed all this
&rsquo;ere time, which she thinks more comferable and gives less
trouble.&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; her pipe, too, most allus a goin&rsquo;,
and some day there&rsquo;ll be the &rsquo;ouse o&rsquo; fire
along o&rsquo; it, I&rsquo;m afeard.&nbsp; And how cleverly she
do hid&rsquo; en, to be sure&mdash;right under piller or blanket
&rsquo;e goes, smokin&rsquo; hot&mdash;soon as ever she hears
passon&rsquo;s footstep on the stairs.&nbsp; Talk of good
&rsquo;bacca hurtin&rsquo; a man.&nbsp; They Lunnon doctors
should come and ha&rsquo; a look at she, and they&rsquo;ll see an
ole woman what&rsquo;s smoked her ounce of shag a day for twenty
years to <i>my</i> sure and sartain knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, &rsquo;tis a grand sight truly this &rsquo;ere
weddin&rsquo;, and a credit to the village and yerself,
Michael.&nbsp; Such a company o&rsquo; rare young maids and lusty
young fellows I don&rsquo;t know as ever I see&rsquo;d
congregated together in one room.&nbsp; And the beer and the
sperrits you&rsquo;ve provided for &rsquo;em!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
been <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>into that there wash-house of yourn, and made glad my
eyes wi&rsquo; as rare a cask of strong beer&mdash;none of your
fourpenny ale, I allow&mdash;and as neat a keg o&rsquo; sperrits
as ever I cast eyes on.&nbsp; The wenches to-night need have
comeliness and grace to tempt the young fellows out o&rsquo; that
there shed.&nbsp; For ale and sperrits is better nor beauty,
Michael; &rsquo;tis so at least when men be gettin&rsquo; in the
vale, the likes o&rsquo; you and I.&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s more,
I&rsquo;ll go and sample it, just that I may tell the others what
&rsquo;tis like, &rsquo;fore as ever the dancin&rsquo;
begins.&nbsp; Not but what I likes a funeral better nor a
weddin&rsquo;.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis quieter and more sober-like, and
you takes your vittles more peaceable.&nbsp; None of this
&rsquo;ere het an&rsquo; dust an&rsquo; potheration what comes
o&rsquo; the dancin&rsquo;.&nbsp; No, gi&rsquo; I a funeral for
comfort, specially when ye be a bit aged.&nbsp; Not but what
&rsquo;tis disperitin&rsquo;, and craves a mortal lot of
stimmilent to carry one thro&rsquo; wi&rsquo; it.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
some there be what doesn&rsquo;t hold wi&rsquo; feastin&rsquo; on
<a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>the
dead.&nbsp; But &rsquo;tis mostly they of a savin&rsquo; sullen
nature, what grudges the vittles, an&rsquo; finds no comfort in
thanksgivin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the voice o&rsquo;
merriment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fun was at its height, and the ale cask and the spirit keg
would have been valued at one half their original cost, when the
company were startled by two hurriedly-repeated knocks at the
door, and a young girl stood panting in their midst.&nbsp; No
wedding guest this&mdash;rather a ghost in all but the strong and
youthful grace of budding womanhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven help us!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s happened to
&rsquo;e, Meg?&nbsp; Why on earth do you bust in upon a house
o&rsquo; merriment lookin&rsquo; like a corpse?&nbsp; Out
wi&rsquo; it, lass, and don&rsquo;t stand gapin&rsquo; there,
scarin&rsquo; us out of our wits, for all the world like a
frighted owl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the p&rsquo;leece!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be ye gone stark starin&rsquo; mad, you fule of a
girl?&nbsp; We ain&rsquo;t that drunk and disorderly yet that we
need fear to look a p&rsquo;leeceman in the face.&nbsp; <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>P&rsquo;leece indeed&mdash;to a decent respectable
woman what&rsquo;s had no dealin&rsquo;s wi&rsquo; such truck,
time out of memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the drink&mdash;&rsquo;tis the
copper off the ship that was wrecked while ago on the
Rudge.&nbsp; Some of us ha&rsquo; been handlin&rsquo; it, and
they&rsquo;re a-comin&rsquo; round to every house in the village,
wi&rsquo; a search-warrant they calls it, and they&rsquo;re at
top o&rsquo; street now, an&rsquo; &rsquo;ll be punchin&rsquo; at
your door afore you can say Jack Robinson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fear&mdash;was it fear for themselves or for others?&mdash;had
sobered the guests on the instant.&nbsp; Silent and shamed they
slunk away into corners, as if they prayed for the earth to
swallow them, or were assisting at a funeral instead of a
wedding.</p>
<p>Only the mistress of the house retained her
self-possession.&nbsp; With a nod at her husband to follow her
she retreated with him for consultation into an adjoining
room.&nbsp; When they returned&mdash;<a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been
thinkin&rsquo; this &rsquo;ere matter over,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and there&rsquo;s nowt to be done but a corpse in the
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sakes alive!&rdquo; cried grandfer, &ldquo;and whose is
the corpse?&nbsp; Not mine, I tell &rsquo;e straight.&nbsp; I be
as full o&rsquo; life and health as the youngest among
&rsquo;e.&nbsp; Not but what they tell I that I be nearin&rsquo;
life&rsquo;s end.&nbsp; Not a bit of it, says I; I be younger and
lustier, I be, than this time last year, and lustier then than
the year afore.&nbsp; I be intended, I allow, to follow
Methusalum, and show what we can do now-along when we sets
ourselves serious to the job of livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop yer silly nonsense, you old fule,&rdquo; cried the
dame, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve no time to listen to your fulery, and
none of us wants yer corpse.&nbsp; Not but what a corpse we must
have&mdash;or maybe a dyin&rsquo; man&rsquo;ll do.&nbsp; Then
they wont dare search the house, and we&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo; time
to pick up the odds and ends of <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>copper and bury it in the
garden.&nbsp; Bad luck that ever I set eyes on it.&nbsp; And
&rsquo;tis young Ned there that must be the dyin&rsquo;
man.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s far and away the most nesh and
tender-lookin&rsquo; of all of us.&nbsp; And crop his hair short,
and lay him in bed wi&rsquo; a bandage full over his face, and no
one&rsquo;ll know whether he&rsquo;s dyin&rsquo; or dead.&nbsp;
And he was allus that weakly and bad in his breath that we can
say he was taken wi&rsquo; heart disease, or summat, along
o&rsquo; the dancin&rsquo;, and no one&rsquo;ll be the
wiser.&nbsp; Besides, &rsquo;tis he what took the copper, so
&rsquo;tis only fair as he should be at the trouble o&rsquo;
savin&rsquo; on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; An&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll put ye in
Arabella&rsquo;s room, Ned&mdash;sure &rsquo;tis no shame to do
so for as how ye be a wedded couple.&nbsp; An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis
safer the copper&rsquo;ll be, seein&rsquo; it be stored under her
bed, the main of it; not but what there&rsquo;s two sheets as was
flatter nor the rest, an&rsquo; they lies &rsquo;twixt mattress
and blanket.&nbsp; Rare an&rsquo; uncomferable &rsquo;twill be
for ye to lay on, but &rsquo;tis yourself <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>what made
the bed an&rsquo; you must lay on&rsquo;t.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
we&rsquo;ll come an&rsquo; let &rsquo;e out as soon as ever the
p&rsquo;leece be gone, an&rsquo; &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t be long as
they&rsquo;ll stay, soon as ever they hears we&rsquo;ve dead
an&rsquo; dyin&rsquo; in the house.&nbsp; Up wi&rsquo; &rsquo;e,
Ned, and we&rsquo;ll have &rsquo;e tucked up afore as ever they
come nigh the place.&nbsp; Sure &rsquo;tis no falsity neither,
for what wi&rsquo; the scare and the fright ye looks most dead
already, so help me, ye does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not till the end of this harangue that Ned&rsquo;s
temper broke loose, though an angry flush that flamed on his
delicate cheek had showed he was nearing the end of his
self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame on ye, woman,&rdquo; he cried, as the last of the
guests filed out of the room, &ldquo;shame on ye to belie me thus
afore the face of your own daughter, and her my wedded
wife.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d a&rsquo; saved the copper for ye
willingly&mdash;rot the stuff&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll save it now if
I can.&nbsp; An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve kept silence afore all your
company rather than let &rsquo;em know you was lying.&nbsp; <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>But
I&rsquo;ll not begin wedded life wi&rsquo; disgrace &rsquo;twixt
me an&rsquo; my wife.&nbsp; So I tell ye, Arabella, where ye
stand, and glad I am of the chance, that I never fingered aught
of the copper&mdash;only to help &rsquo;em in hidin&rsquo;
it&mdash;and &rsquo;twas your own father and mother what stript
it and stored it, and you needn&rsquo;t be afeared but what
you&rsquo;ve wedded an honest man.&nbsp; And now,&rdquo; turning
to his mother-in-law, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to go along
wi&rsquo; ye.&nbsp; May be I&rsquo;ll save your honour; we
can&rsquo;t make worse o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In ten minute&rsquo;s time the house that had been ablaze with
lights was shrouded in darkness, and resumed its ordinary
well-conditioned aspect.&nbsp; The blinds were drawn, articles of
furniture that had been ousted and piled to meet the requirements
of the dancing had been re-placed in position.&nbsp; The guests
had slunk away, more or less disquieted according to the state of
each man&rsquo;s inner consciousness, and, to the onlooker from
without, it <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>was as reposeful and undisturbed as any of its
neighbours in the quiet well-ordered street.</p>
<p>Scarcely had this transformation scene been effected when the
expected summons came.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sorry to disturb ye, Mrs.
Bond, when ye be all arranged so quiet for the night.&nbsp; But
&rsquo;tis our bounden duty, ma&rsquo;am, and we&rsquo;ve a very
particular reason here (exhibiting the warrant) for wishin&rsquo;
to look through your premises, if so be as you has no
objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, ye can come in, Bob Davis.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if I
can&rsquo;t gi&rsquo; ye a hearty welcome, &rsquo;tis only
yerself you has to thank for it.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twould ha&rsquo;
been more neighbour-like, I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo;, if ye&rsquo;d
come in open daylight, &rsquo;stead o&rsquo; disturbin&rsquo; a
peaceful family at this hour o&rsquo; the night.&nbsp; An&rsquo;
we wi&rsquo; sickness in the house that&rsquo;s like to be death
afore the mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; For sure as ever Ned sees yer face
an&rsquo; that great lout you&rsquo;ve brought in wi&rsquo; ye,
&rsquo;twill scare the life <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>breath out on &rsquo;m.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; &rsquo;tis more nor that scrap o&rsquo; paper
you&rsquo;ll be needin&rsquo; then to make yer peace, wi&rsquo;
murder on yer soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, old lady, none of that gammon; it&rsquo;s too
good for us.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t we know that your daughter has
been married this very day, and that you was a-keepin&rsquo; the
weddin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a fiddle and dancin&rsquo; till
half-an-hour ago?&nbsp; Besides, there&rsquo;s a strong suspicion
that some of the copper we&rsquo;re a-lookin&rsquo; for is to be
found in this here house&mdash;and perhaps that&rsquo;s why you
shut up so sharp, hearin&rsquo; that we were comin&rsquo; along
to have a look at ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But when the search elsewhere was ended, and the door of
Arabella&rsquo;s room had been opened to admit them, Mrs. Bond
enjoyed a short-lived triumph.&nbsp; Not the most strenuous of
officials, urged by the strongest sense of duty, but would have
paused in the presence of what looked like death.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;though thank you
kindly&mdash;we&rsquo;ll not intrude.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve done our
duty, an&rsquo; the law itself can&rsquo;t call on us for
more.&nbsp; An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll look after that lad of yourn,
Mrs. Bond; you&rsquo;ll excuse me for sayin&rsquo; it.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis close on death he looks, though glad I&rsquo;d be to
be mistaken.&nbsp; An&rsquo; if so be &rsquo;twill ease your
mind, I&rsquo;ll make time to go an&rsquo; fetch the doctor for
ye afore as ever I goes home to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the bedroom upstairs, as the steps of the officers were
heard retreating down the street, the bride was saying: &ldquo;Up
wi&rsquo; you, Ned!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be glad, I allow, that I
be come to release you.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t becomin&rsquo;
no wise that a bridegroom on the night of his weddin&rsquo;
should be lyin&rsquo; all stark an&rsquo; streaked like a
corpse.&nbsp; Not but what you look finer and grander-like than
ever you&rsquo;ll do in life agin.&nbsp; Up wi&rsquo; you, man,
though I be most sorry, that I be, to untie ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>But
no voice or sound made answer from the bed.&nbsp; Only the jaw
had fallen, and the eyes stared full on the speaker, and the
silence of death&mdash;death itself&mdash;was in the room.&nbsp;
Fear and excitement had done their work on an enfeebled heart,
and Ned had crossed the narrow borderland&mdash;the &ldquo;space
between the spears&rdquo; the ancients called it&mdash;which
separates God&rsquo;s great twin armies, the living and the
dead.</p>
<p>The villagers will tell you that Death came to him in anger,
because of the jest that travestied his grim prerogative.&nbsp;
Rather, I think, it was in pity for the lad, and to save him from
disillusions sadder still, that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;God&rsquo;s
finger touched him, and he slept.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the marriage was followed by a death, and the lighter
refreshments of the dance were merged in the splendours of a
funeral feast.&nbsp; And the soul of granfer Wiseman was
satisfied withal.</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The
Rector was sorely troubled by the disaster that had taken from
him another of his prime favourites among the lads of the
village.</p>
<p>But of the events that had led up to it he was strangely
tolerant.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s heredity,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and you can&rsquo;t fight against it.&nbsp; Not an angel
from heaven could persuade them that the sea has not made over to
them all the property it lays at their doors.&nbsp; It
mayn&rsquo;t be good law,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but, after all,
there&rsquo;s something to be said in favour of their
view.&rdquo;</p>

164</span>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now, during the calm and quiet
summer months that followed, my life took its tone from the
harmony of Nature, and rested itself for a while in one great
calm.&nbsp; Taking its rest like Nature, the better to prepare
itself against the advent of stress and storm.</p>
<p>Hardly a day passed during this halcyon time that I did not
see Marion.&nbsp; Sometimes it would be at the Rectory, sometimes
at the Manor House; oftener still in some cottage where there was
sickness <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>or trouble which she could comfort and relieve.&nbsp;
To ourselves, at any rate, life in those days was full of
interest; it may be, for that very reason, void of interest to
those who only watched its progress from without.</p>
<p>One day the rooks re-appeared in the trees of the Manor House
farm.&nbsp; I suppose it was one of the periodical visits which
they are accustomed to pay, off and on, before they close their
summer establishment finally to take up their abode in some
mysterious winter residence.&nbsp; In my boyish days it seemed to
me the height of unwisdom to abandon your city of habitation just
when the winter gales were due.&nbsp; But perhaps a rook lives
his real life elsewhere, and only comes down to rusticate in the
country as a volunteer or militiaman goes into camp, <i>i.e.</i>
for duty&rsquo;s sake, which, in the case of the rook, means the
fatigue duty of rearing and raising a family.&nbsp; Somewhere (in
the pages of the <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>&lsquo;Encyclopaedia Britannica&rsquo; for example) and
some day I will look up their winter address.&nbsp; In this
neighbourhood it is probably among the cliffs of Portland or on
the rock-bound promontory of St. Aldhelm&rsquo;s Head that a
letter would find them.&nbsp; Anyhow, they were with us again
to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they talk to one another, Peggy?&rdquo; I
said, as they were making a great to-do in the trees adjoining
our garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, sir, I&rsquo;m sure; but if they do,
it&rsquo;s pretty much, I allow, on the same subject.&nbsp; Seems
like a warning of some kind to my ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it may be, Peggy, and, so far as I can read it,
couched in very classical language.&nbsp; It sounds to me exactly
like the Latin word &lsquo;cave,&rsquo; which your favourite
Reggie must often have told you means &lsquo;take
care.&rsquo;&nbsp; We pronounce the word now-a-days
&lsquo;caue,&rsquo; which, in the clipt pronunciation of an
excited rook, might easily have degenerated <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>into
&lsquo;caw.&rsquo;&nbsp; If so, they are very lavish of their
presentiments at the present moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And no wonder,&rdquo; was Peggy&rsquo;s reply,
&ldquo;for there&rsquo;s trouble enough and to spare in the
village to-day.&nbsp; And will be through all the country round
for the matter of that.&nbsp; You know, I suppose, sir, that the
bank has failed?&nbsp; There were whispers of it in the street
last evening, and to-day the postman tells me that the shutters
are up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced at the letters on the table before me&mdash;at an
aggressive-looking blue one in particular, which might possibly
contain a bill&mdash;a letter of the kind that one ordinarily
leaves unopened till the last.&nbsp; In it was a short circular,
confirming the fact of the failure in the plain unsympathetic
language with which a disaster that spells ruin to hundreds is
officially announced.</p>
<p>There are many ways in which a bank may fail, though the
result in all of them is pretty much <a name="page168"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 168</span>the same in the end.&nbsp; Sometimes
it dies of inanition, by a slow decay of life and credit, and
this is the form of suicide that novelists and journalists
prefer.&nbsp; For it offers a fine field for sensational
writing&mdash;the whispers in the air, the mysteries and doubts;
then the &lsquo;run,&rsquo; with all its train of interesting
incidents, the reinforcements of gold that are hurried down post
haste from London, the noise and tumult of desperate claimants,
with the cashier&rsquo;s final announcement that his resources
are exhausted.</p>
<p>Sometimes, on the other hand, the suicide is sudden, without
preliminary word or warning&mdash;&lsquo;foudroyant,&rsquo; as
the French would call it.&nbsp; And this is how our bank elected
to fall.&nbsp; To the last it drew in money and paid it out, and
then on a grey November morning the shutters were up, for the
bank had died in the night.&nbsp; But for us in Fleetwater there
was not even the poor satisfaction <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>of watching its last hours or gazing
upon the closed shutters.&nbsp; For the bank had died elsewhere,
at the county town some miles away, and the news had only
filtered to us at second hand (as Peggy told me) through the
postman.</p>
<p>Most people, I suppose, were stunned at first by the novelty
of the disaster.&nbsp; I can remember that for some definite
period, how long I never knew, I studied the circular before me
dreamily, with a strange feeling that it would be bad for some
other people, but never realising what it meant for me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What will Peggy do?&rdquo; I asked myself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She had all her savings, I know, invested in it.&nbsp; And
what again of Richard Smiley, who only two days ago placed in it
all that the Old Inn has earned for him in twenty
years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worse still, I thought, for Andrew Strong and his widowed
mother, before whom I saw nothing but the refuge of the Union,
for they were old and <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>feeble now, and had been living, I
knew, for years on the slender pittance they drew in driblets
from the bank.&nbsp; And so by degrees, and through many vague
wanderings of thought, by realising all that it meant for others,
I came at last to realise all that it meant for me.</p>
<p>At this point in my meditations I did what it would have been
wiser for me to do a few months earlier, when I should have been
in time to act upon the Squire&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; I bethought
me of turning up the original prospectus of the bank where it had
lain forgotten among a number of old papers, mostly unimportant,
that had come into my possession at the time of my father&rsquo;s
death.&nbsp; The information that I gained from it was
startling.&nbsp; It was to the effect that the company had been
registered in shares of &pound;50 each, only half of which had
been as yet called up.&nbsp; So I had no need to go to London to
win the knowledge that I was a ruined man.</p>
<p><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>This
time I did not lose myself in vain misgivings.&nbsp; I had
become, I suppose, already somewhat callous to surprise.&nbsp;
But I set myself the task of looking the future in the face by
thinking and working out my plans on the basis of this new
discovery.&nbsp; And I took the business in hand with something
of that strange unquestioning instinct which leads the fatalist
to work out his destiny in a crisis that has come upon him
suddenly, and over which he has lost the control.</p>
<p>Whereby I saw that, under the best possible conditions, I had
no right to continue my claim to Marion&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; Even
now there were rumours afloat in the village that the failure was
a bad one, and that the bank would only pay a small
dividend.&nbsp; And, though I could not satisfy myself on this
point till I had been to London to consult my agents, as I
intended to do on the following day, it was already perfectly
clear that the company <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>would have to call up all its
capital, and that, dividend or no dividend, the result to me
would be the loss of most of my small fortune.</p>
<p>And this meant, first of all, the loss of Marion.&nbsp; How
could I ask her father to consent to our marriage, even if his
opinion on a contingency which was now realised had been less
plainly given at the time of our engagement?</p>
<p>No; neither he nor I could have consented to it.&nbsp; And so
the failure meant to me the loss of all that, for the time at any
rate, made life worth living.&nbsp; Other work I could get, of
course; possibly other friends.&nbsp; But a love like
Marion&rsquo;s never again.&nbsp; And, for the time, I could
bring myself to think of nothing save the loss of her.&nbsp; I
was young, it is true, but not weak, I think, in character; and I
could never picture myself in the future as loving another with
such love as I had given her.&nbsp; Yet she and I must surely
part.&nbsp; The clearest and most <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>decisive judgment dictated it.&nbsp;
And I must be the one to go.</p>
<p>Even if I had been content to remain among my present
surroundings, every smallest detail of which reminded me of her,
yet for her sake my continuance in Fleetwater was
impossible.&nbsp; If I stayed, it would mean for her nothing less
than banishment from her father and her home.</p>
<p>I had asked the Rector to tell her of my discovery and of the
changes that must follow from it.&nbsp; Not yet could I see her
personally.&nbsp; Only I asked her to meet me a few hours later
for a walk in the adjoining forest.&nbsp; Perhaps that few
hours&rsquo; interval might tell me in what words to greet
her.</p>
<p>With the Rector my arrangements were quickly made.&nbsp; Once
put in possession of the facts he saw, clearly as I had done,
that I had decided on the only course that was open to me under
the circumstances <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>of the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;No honourable man could have
done otherwise,&rdquo; he said, and, as he grasped my hand at
parting, the same kindly look came into his eye that had welcomed
me on the first day we met in the Rectory study.&nbsp; Only time
and our warm friendship had strengthened it into the look with
which a father greets his well-beloved son.</p>
<h2><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Squire was wise enough not to
embitter my position by attempting to alter my resolution.&nbsp;
He had meant what he said at our former interview, and remembered
it too.&nbsp; It was too late for him to retract now, even if he
had been tempted to do so from a false regard for his
daughter&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>The walk with Marion, to which I had looked forward with
something of dread, was made almost a happiness by her quiet
fortitude.&nbsp; I need not, I found, have steeled my heart and
strengthened my mind with arguments for leaving her.&nbsp; She
was <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>not
the woman to make of my sorrow a burden heavier still to
bear.&nbsp; She might have told her love in the words of which
quotation has made a platitude:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I could not love thee, dear, so much,<br />
Loved I not honour more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not by so much as a suggestion would she have made the path
before me more difficult.&nbsp; She had realised, almost before I
had told her my intention, that not only my honour, but even my
very love for her, necessitated our parting.&nbsp; Only, instead
of the parting almost without hope as I had pictured it, she made
of it a parting that had in it sure promise that we should meet
again.</p>
<p>We knew each other&rsquo;s love too well by now for need of
speech.&nbsp; Our walk was almost a silent one, except for the
words with which she ever and again encouraged my despondency,
and directed it, by <a name="page177"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 177</span>her own strong confidence, towards
the hopefulness she was determined I should share.</p>
<p>Instinctively, and without acknowledged purpose, our steps led
us to a spot that we had visited again and again in the earlier
part of the summer that was gone.</p>
<p>It was a miniature forest, embedded in a sheltered valley that
lay beyond the outskirts of the village between the elbows of two
mighty hills.&nbsp; Protected by these watchful guardians, it was
safe from the withering gales that swept up from the
Atlantic.&nbsp; When all the surrounding trees stood bare and
blighted by recurrent storms, Nature, in this quiet nook, was
permitted to fulfil her perfect work, changing her garb, as month
by month passed on, from emerald to sober green, but always
keeping her brightest tints to weave her funeral robe, folding it
at last upon her bosom with the air of one who has lived her life
and done her <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>work, and now falls peacefully to sleep in painless,
restful weariness.</p>
<p>It was one of those perfect days in latest autumn that seem
intended to give us, just once or twice in the year, and
especially before it leaves us, an idea of all the glorious
adornments Nature has in her keeping.&nbsp; Perhaps the brightest
beds in a nobleman&rsquo;s <i>parterre</i> might suggest the
colouring.&nbsp; But the stiff arrangement and orderly rows of
bloom are the very antipodes of Nature&rsquo;s handiwork.&nbsp; A
flush of crimson mountain-ash, thrusting itself in irregular
patches between groups of dusky pines, and these in their turn
lost among beeches of burnished gold, with oak and hornbeam and
ash to give the softer intermediate tones is, at best, a
poverty-stricken catalogue of the colours that flamed all round
us on that autumn day.&nbsp; No marvel that to a dweller by our
storm-swept seas, when a gale in August will wither all the rest
of <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>our
foliage two months before it falls, the scene I am describing
should be the one we chose to close around our parting.</p>
<p>It was in the depths of this fairy forest that we lost
ourselves&mdash;Marion and I.&nbsp; We met no one by the
way.&nbsp; Nothing but the silent trees above us with their mist
of tangled colours, and at our feet a maze of undergrowth only
just less brilliant in colouring than the tree-tops overhead,
with an occasional squirrel or blackbird or thrush to suggest the
life with which the scene had palpitated in the sweltering summer
heat.&nbsp; Even the voices of the birds were silent.&nbsp; They
would only have marred the peaceful stillness of that wondrous
day.&nbsp; Till the early autumn evening began to close about us,
and it was time to set our faces homewards.</p>
<p>And after we had left the forest we turned aside through a
bye-lane of the village to mount <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>once more the Chapel hill, feeling,
both of us, that the spot which had seen the consecration of our
love would be the fitting witness of its untimely end.&nbsp; And
there we said good-bye.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never marry,
Harold,&rdquo; Marion said, &ldquo;till you come back again to
claim me.&nbsp; For come again you surely will.&nbsp; And never
think I blame you for this parting.&nbsp; In honour you could not
have done otherwise than leave me now.&nbsp; And hard as it is,
dear, for us to part so soon, my love (if that be possible) is
only made the stronger by the parting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so she left me&mdash;with none of the prayers and protests
that would only have made my duty harder for me.&nbsp; With
nothing but a confident hope, in which I could not bring myself
as yet to share, that time in its course would smooth away all
difficulties in the fulfilment of our love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When that day comes,&rdquo; and these were her last
words, &ldquo;we will meet once more, Harold, in <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>this same
place, and dedicate anew the love which chances like this will
have been powerless to change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day we parted: I on my visit to Eric in London, and
she to a relative in the Midlands, with whom she was to stay
during the month I should remain at Fleetwater.</p>
<h2><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Of</span> course you&rsquo;re going
to stay with me, old man?&rdquo; said Eric, when he met me at
Waterloo station next day.&nbsp; &ldquo;You surely didn&rsquo;t
imagine I should let you go to an hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing in these few words of the studied tone of
unimpeachable politeness to which he had accustomed me at our
last meeting.&nbsp; This was the hearty undergraduate greeting of
old, and I needed no more to tell me that his sorrow on my
account had dispersed the cloud that lay between us.</p>
<p>It was good to see him again; to feel the grasp <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>of his
strong hand, and read the look of welcome in his troubled
eyes.&nbsp; And then we went to dine at
&lsquo;Simpson&rsquo;s&rsquo; in reminiscence of the past, when I
had had a pleasant balance to draw upon, and banks had not taken
to breaking.&nbsp; And then for a long stroll and back again to
his rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I&rsquo;ve got them all ready for you, and the
lobster supper that you always favoured, though how on earth you
manage to sleep after it, passes my comprehension.&nbsp; And then
we&rsquo;ll chat on as in the good old days, and fancy ourselves
undergraduates again, and that all this trouble is an evil
dream.&nbsp; And remember that a room will always be kept ready
for you in the future.&nbsp; Send me a wire when you want to use
it, and the oftener you come and the longer you stay the better
for me.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s late in the day of our friendship to
be telling you all this, as if you hadn&rsquo;t known it years
and years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>All
my vague misgivings had vanished before his welcome, and it has
dwelt with me since as a pleasurable thought that Eric, I am
sure, meant fairly by me then, and that for what happened later
on between us, the blame in part must rest with me, who had
spread, however unwittingly, a snare before his feet.</p>
<p>After supper we drew up our chairs side-by-side before the
fire&mdash;for the autumn evenings had become chilly now in
town&mdash;and discussed the situation from every possible view
and bearing, without, I candidly admit, finding any means of
bettering it.</p>
<p>Eric was far too wise to offer me monetary help.&nbsp; But his
hand-grasp told me I might have had it for the asking&mdash;aye,
anything he could have given me.&nbsp; And I grew cheerier and
more hopeful of the future, and thought with thankfulness how
much it means to any man to have just one true <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>friend in
life.&nbsp; How few of us can say as much, especially when
life&rsquo;s sun begins to verge towards its setting, and the
friends we have made are gone before us, and ourselves have lost
the will and opportunity to win us new ones.</p>
<p>To-night I was tasting this cup of happiness in fullest
measure.&nbsp; Time for me had rolled backwards, and he and I
were together again&mdash;the friend in whom I could see no
change; the lad who in days gone by had slipped up with me from
Cambridge for many an evening just like this.</p>
<p>The next morning I went to call upon my agents, after
arranging with Eric to meet him in the Strand at the private
gallery where his picture was on view.</p>
<p>In those early days there was little information, I knew, to
be expected from them, and such as it was it only went to confirm
my gloomy forecast.&nbsp; The bank, they told me, was
irretrievably ruined, and <a name="page186"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 186</span>all the capital it could command
would infallibly be called up.</p>
<p>Afterwards I joined Eric in the Strand, and he took me into a
room from which all natural light had been carefully
excluded.&nbsp; And as I stood looking at a curtain which
shrouded the farther wall, it suddenly rolled back, and under a
perfect light, and with all the accessories that art could lend
to its environment, I saw before me the picture that had made him
famous.</p>
<p>It was in no wise a sensational subject.&nbsp; Only a
precipitous rock, rent in twain by a huge fissure, through which
I looked down upon a valley which opened and fell away in front
of me.&nbsp; From its foot a mountain stream foamed and fretted
down a steep incline.&nbsp; And on either side of the valley,
wherever a projection or an eminence promised safety from the
torrents that scored the declivities, tiny sparks of fire, few
and far between, flickered <a name="page187"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 187</span>from the cottage windows, with a
pleasant suggestion of the cheeriness within.&nbsp; Crowning the
precipice which occupied the foreground on the right hand of the
picture, I could see the outline of the village church, where
glowed a larger, ruddier flame, from the lamp, no doubt, which
burned before the altar of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful piece of work for a lad so young in
years.&nbsp; I am no painter, and the defects there may have been
in it were all invisible to me.&nbsp; But the cleverness of the
composition, and the marvellous adjustment of the lights and
shadows, flung by the afterglow upon the surrounding hills, could
only have been inspired by genius.&nbsp; No wonder that his work
had made him famous.</p>
<p>He had entitled it &ldquo;Val Verde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It commemorates a story, Harold,&rdquo; he
whispered&mdash;for there were visitors besides
ourselves&mdash;&ldquo;that has grown up around a picture which
forms <a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>the altar-piece of the church.&nbsp; Whether the legend
rests on any historic ground-work, I could never satisfactorily
determine.&nbsp; I only know that versions of it, in many various
forms, are current in most of the adjoining villages.&nbsp; But
this evening, if you like, I will tell it to you precisely as it
was told to me by the cur&eacute; of the parish.&nbsp; True or
untrue, it is interesting enough as a story, though I could wish
we had fallen upon a more cheerful topic for the enlivenment of
our last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we were leaving the gallery, I bethought me of the picture
which Reggie had unearthed for me at Cambridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Eric,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a picture, too, in my possession, on which I want your
opinion.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t mind the trouble, old man,
I&rsquo;ll send it up to you when I get home to-morrow.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s only a copy, for I&rsquo;ve seen the original.&nbsp;
But it&rsquo;s a fairly good one, unless I am much
mistaken.&nbsp; <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>And in these days, when I don&rsquo;t know where to
look for a five-pound note, anything, however small, will come in
handy.&nbsp; So, if you think it&rsquo;s worth a few pounds,
please do the best you can for me, and I&rsquo;ll be awfully
grateful.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening, as we sat before
the fire, Eric told me the story. <a name="citation190"></a><a
href="#footnote190" class="citation">[190]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;I had lost my way in the Abruzzi.&nbsp; All the day
long I had wandered in fruitless quest of a subject to complete
my series of Italian sketches.&nbsp; And now the twilight had
fallen upon me with the suddenness of an Italian autumn.&nbsp; Up
to this time I had followed the guidance of a faint bridle-path,
but on a sudden the ground shelved downwards, and I found myself
at the entrance of a narrow ravine, confronted by a blank,
precipitous rock, <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>while the path I had been following wandered off to the
left, and was lost in the obscurity of the moor beyond.&nbsp;
Nothing in the shape of a village, nothing that promised me a
shelter for the night, was visible on the moorland I had been
traversing.&nbsp; So my only hope lay in the chance of what might
lie beyond the rock that barred my progress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stumbling and halting at every step, for the night was
falling rapidly and progress rendered difficult by boulders and
watercourses, I at length made my way past the obstruction
through a fissure at the side, and found to my delight that the
subject of my picture lay before me.&nbsp; What it was you have
seen to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheered by my good fortune, for the wind was rising
rapidly, and there was every suggestion of an autumn gale, I made
for one of the larger cottages that faced me.&nbsp; I had chosen
well, as the event proved, for I found it to be the residence of
<a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>the
village priest&mdash;a kindly and refined old man&mdash;who met
me at the door with outstretched hands, and with a welcome that
in England we accord only to long-established friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You are welcome, my son, most welcome,&rsquo; he
began.&nbsp; &lsquo;Few visitors reach me in this Val
Verde&mdash;for so I have christened it, not very appropriately,
I fear, but in memory of my home in Spain&mdash;and when they do
come we keep them, be assured, for as long as they will
stay.&nbsp; But now let me show you my guest-chamber.&nbsp; Poor
as it is, it is better than would have fallen to your lot if you
had missed the entrance to our valley.&nbsp; And in an hour
Annetta will be ready with our evening meal, and afterwards we
will sit and talk over a flask of Chianti till late into the
night.&nbsp; Or rather, you shall talk and I will listen, for
news of the outer world is the payment we exact from our visitors
for such welcome as we can give them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&ldquo;Annetta was still busy with her preparations
when I rejoined him in the little sitting-room, so comfortable in
its contrast with the world outside, where a hurricane raged and
roared through the ravines that fell away from either side of the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the window and looked out at the tiny lights
blinking from the cottages like glow-worms that had lost their
confidence.&nbsp; And right on the top of the grim rock facing me
gleamed the red light from the church that crowned its
summit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The story of a terrible tragedy attaches to that
lamp,&rsquo; said my host, who had come forward to join me.&nbsp;
And his words, by a strange coincidence, came almost as an answer
to my thought.&nbsp; &lsquo;When we settle down,&rsquo; he added,
&lsquo;for our evening chat, my contribution to our entertainment
shall be the story of the tragedy that it commemorates.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, as Annetta is behindhand with her preparations, and
will not serve us <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>yet awhile, do you feel bold enough to climb that hill
with me in face of the storm, and see for yourself what my church
contains?&nbsp; It can boast, at any rate, of one good picture,
which, by the way, you ought to study before you hear the story I
have promised you, and with which it is connected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;With pleasure,&rsquo; was my reply,
&lsquo;though surely it is hardly fair to judge a picture on a
night like this, and by what looks like the glimmer of one feeble
lamp.&nbsp; It would be difficult, I imagine, to devise worse
conditions for appreciating an artist&rsquo;s work.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;As a rule, no doubt.&nbsp; But remember that
pictures, like music, may be composed to suit certain
accompaniments; and this is one of them, as I think you will
admit, if you are content to take my words on trust and brave the
storm in faith of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;Lantern in hand, the old man sallied forth, and
I followed him.&nbsp; The distance was not so great as I had
anticipated, nor the wind so overpowering.&nbsp; The church was
really nearer than I had judged it to be in the twilight of the
approaching night, and the precipice up which our pathway lay
acted as a barrier to the wind, which had gathered in the
moorland beyond, and, parted into two currents, swept the defiles
on either side of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On entering the church I saw at once that the main
building was in darkness, save for the glimmering flame before
the sanctuary.&nbsp; But from a side chapel that opened on the
choir streamed another and fuller radiance, which had been
concentrated by a careful adjustment on the picture I had come to
study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a &lsquo;Descent from the Cross,&rsquo; left by
the artist, as I gathered at a glance, in an unfinished
state.&nbsp; Nothing indeed had been attempted except <a
name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>the central
Figure, which lay unattended and alone at the foot of the
Cross.&nbsp; One weak and wavering line, visible only to the
expert&rsquo;s eye, might have been taken to imply that, worn out
by his task, the painter had flung down his brush, and, satisfied
or dissatisfied with the result, had never cared to re-touch his
work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet satisfied he surely must have been, for, in spite
of numerous faults, it was great, immeasurably great, in rough
untutored power.&nbsp; What most impressed me was the terrible
truthfulness with which he had realised the details.&nbsp;
Surely, such total collapse, such limp and inert limbs, such
lights and shadows on the livid skin, were never the outcome of
the painter&rsquo;s consciousness?&nbsp; Death alone, and death
that was only just not life, had been the model from which he
drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, as I studied it more closely, other minor
details grew out of the obscurity and impressed <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>themselves
upon me.&nbsp; It was unfinished, as I said, and had been painted
with lightning rapidity, probably at a single sitting.&nbsp; It
had been painted, too, by artificial light&mdash;the tone of the
colouring proved it&mdash;but painted certainly to suit its
surroundings, and probably on the very spot where we stood to
view it.&nbsp; Now and again, as the wind forced its way through
the time-worn casement, it swayed the draperies that hung around
the picture&mdash;only another accessory, or so it seemed, to
which the painter had attuned his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Strong and terrible as a Ribera,&rsquo; was my
verdict, &lsquo;but a Ribera inspired and glorified.&rsquo;&nbsp;
For this was no morbid study of Death the Destroyer&rsquo;s
handiwork.&nbsp; No; the artist had carried his subject far
beyond the dominion of Death, when he transfigured the Face on
the canvas with the light of an Everlasting Love.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the evening after supper Eric
told me the story of the picture as he had heard it from his
friend the priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years ago,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;for so I heard
the story on my arrival in the parish&mdash;a rich Englishman,
travelling for pleasure, found his way to our village, and,
intending to stay three weeks, was detained for eight.&nbsp; For
he had caught the fever which prevails in the lower valleys, and
only recovered from it thanks to the care he received from my
predecessor in the house to which it has <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>been my
pleasure to welcome you.&nbsp; On his departure he left a hundred
pounds with the priest as a thank-offering for his recovery, on
the understanding that it was to be employed in the purchase of
an altar-piece for our church, painted, if possible, by some
local artist from the surrounding district.&nbsp; Many competed,
but it was felt from the first that the honour was as good as won
by Agostino Villari, a young painter of extraordinary talent, who
lived in the house I showed you at the further end of the
village.&nbsp; At that time he was only twenty&mdash;hardly more
than a boy&mdash;and his talent was almost wholly
undeveloped.&nbsp; But he only wanted time and teaching.&nbsp;
The power was there, as you have seen for yourself to-day.&nbsp;
Well, Agostino had but one great friend, a cousin, who shared his
house, sat for his model, and whose single hope and assurance was
that Agostino would live to be a famous painter.&nbsp; Cecco, for
so he was <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>called, was about thirty, a pale sedate man, of a
gentle loving nature.&nbsp; But why describe him?&nbsp; You have
seen him to-day, pictured by his friend&rsquo;s hand as no words
of mine could paint him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the time for the competition drew on, the two
friends were wholly absorbed in anticipating the result.&nbsp;
Agostino was to be immortalised as the painter, Cecco as the
model.&nbsp; And their love for each other made them wholly
unselfish; each hoped for success solely in the interest of his
friend.&nbsp; Nothing short of a perfect likeness would satisfy
Agostino, nothing short of a perfect picture would satisfy
Cecco&rsquo;s ambition for his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the night before the pictures were to be sent in,
the two went up together to the church, to place the painting in
position and to judge of its effect, taking with them the
materials for retouching it if it should be required.&nbsp; It
was a wild night&mdash;<a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>a night like this (for the story is
precise in its details)&mdash;and the two friends had a hard
climb up the hill to the church, where they placed the picture in
the side chapel, because they could utilise the stronger light to
throw into relief the details of the composition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask for the result?&nbsp; Well, Cecco was in
raptures.&nbsp; &lsquo;It is immortality, &rsquo;Tino,&rsquo; he
cried, &lsquo;for both of us.&nbsp; How great you are!&nbsp; It
is I&mdash;I myself, and to the very life&mdash;only grander,
nobler, spiritualised.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, it is you,&rsquo;
said &rsquo;Tino hesitatingly, &lsquo;you, no doubt, and to the
very life, as you say.&nbsp; But will that do?&nbsp; Look at that
face, that chest, those firm and muscular limbs.&nbsp; True to
life, I admit, well-drawn and well-painted.&nbsp; But life, not
death, and <i>death</i> is what we wanted.&nbsp; Strip yourself,
Cecco, and lie at the foot of the Cross; see if you can help
me.&nbsp; You know I can never paint the smallest detail without
a model.&nbsp; There&mdash;<a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>fling yourself down in a heap as if
you had lost all strength, all energy.&nbsp; Yes, that is
well.&nbsp; You have given me the attitude.&nbsp; But the blood,
the rich colouring in your face and limbs&mdash;it is life,
vigorous life, all of it&mdash;and I cannot even picture what
they would be like, shrunk and colourless and lifeless.&nbsp; If
you could only faint, Cecco, I might do something.&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t you faint&mdash;just for one moment&mdash;just to
oblige me?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, &rsquo;Tino, but I will do
more for you and the picture than that.&nbsp; Only promise to
finish it&mdash;here, this evening, before you leave the
church.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tino, remember, <i>I count upon your
promise</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One short swift stroke, and he had dealt himself the
blow before &rsquo;Tino&rsquo;s hand could stay him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But &rsquo;Tino set up his easel beside the corpse, and
all the night through he painted&mdash;painted as if the Furies
were upon him&mdash;till the dawn looked in at the window and his
friend&rsquo;s form took shape <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>on the canvas, and the task that had
been appointed him was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then &rsquo;Tino, too, vanished from among us, leaving
the story of Cecco&rsquo;s death in writing beside the
corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was said by some, but never believed by those
who knew him, that &rsquo;Tino had slain his friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was some time before I or Eric spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder what became of &rsquo;Tino,&rdquo; I
murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Stay; do not tell me, even if the legend
has recorded it.&nbsp; I can picture it without words.&nbsp;
Lonely he must have been, for he had seen that which must have
built a barrier for ever between him and the world outside.&nbsp;
And I can assume with equal certainty that he never handled brush
or palette again.&nbsp; And sometimes&mdash;always at
night&mdash;he would reappear at the church and watch through <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>the
darkness in company with his friend.&nbsp; Yes, lonely he must
have been&mdash;but not unhappy, brightened by a great love here
and by a vision of the Greater beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I returned to Fleetwater,
Marion was gone.&nbsp; It was better so, I felt, much as I missed
her.&nbsp; Indeed, our last good-bye had been said in the place
she had chosen for it,&mdash;on the Chapel Hill where she had
turned and left me.</p>
<p>Two days later Eric&rsquo;s verdict on the picture came.&nbsp;
It was short and to the point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dear Harold,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a Bronzino (he wrote), the great
Bronzino at Madrid.&nbsp; I mean, of course, a copy.&nbsp; But a
remarkably good one, and worth something if only for the
excellence of the work.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll do what I can with
it.&nbsp; The original is safe, <a name="page206"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 206</span>as you know, in the Museum at
Madrid&mdash;at least it was, unless you have stolen it since I
left the place last autumn.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Eric</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not know what other answer we could have expected.&nbsp;
But notwithstanding, it was a disappointment to all of us.&nbsp;
Most fortunate it proved that I had seen the original at Madrid,
and been able, in consequence, to repress the growing confidence
of those around me in the value of the picture.&nbsp; Indeed, I
had been obliged to insist on this point again and again in my
conversations with the Rector and Marion, neither of whom could
in any wise be persuaded that it was only a copy.&nbsp; Marion,
if possible, had been the more obstinate of the two, and had
almost succeeded in convincing me that I had never seen the
original at all.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe it was a dream,
Harold,&rdquo; she <a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
207</span>would say, &ldquo;and that you only fancied you saw
it.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;ve had the same feeling a hundred times
over.&nbsp; Dreams with me often take such a real and tangible
form that I&rsquo;ve found myself hunting again and again for
some article which I was sure I had in my possession, and which
very possibly never existed at all.&nbsp; Reason in such cases is
absolutely powerless.&nbsp; Even to this very day I constantly
wake up with a belief that I&rsquo;ve bought a whole gallery of
pictures, and am short of the money to pay for them.&nbsp; And so
real is the fancy that I could describe to you at this moment the
shop where I bought them, the man who sold them to me, and the
subject of each picture in detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Besides, you must have been picture-blind by the time
you got to Madrid.&nbsp; By your own showing it came at the end
of a long round of galleries, and I suspect that this
dream-picture of yours is a sort of blend of all the best
pictures <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>you&rsquo;d been seeing at Rome and Florence and
Dresden.&nbsp; A cardinal gave you the dress, and Bindo Altoviti
the face, and lo and behold you had your portrait
complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Rector, who had a fine eye for drawing and colouring,
had been not one whit more easy to persuade.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t solve the mystery, Stirling.&nbsp; But of one thing
I&rsquo;m certain&mdash;that no copyist did it.&nbsp; Do you mean
to tell me that a painter who could do work like that would waste
his time on the slavish task of copying?&nbsp; Why, the man who
painted that picture might command the Royal Academy.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no such easy matter, remember, to reproduce a picture
in flaming scarlet, without a touch of any other colour to
relieve it.&nbsp; Try it, my boy&mdash;you&rsquo;re a dabbler in
the art yourself&mdash;and see if you can produce anything on the
same lines that will be worth hanging as a signboard on the
village Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Even
Peggy, too, had had her fling at my unbelief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
it&rsquo;s simply lovely, Mr. Stirling,&rdquo; she&rsquo;d tell
me, &ldquo;though I say it as shouldn&rsquo;t, for it goes sore
against my conscience to praise that idolatrous young heathen,
who, but for the cut of his dress, might be the Scarlet Woman
herself.&nbsp; And even she couldn&rsquo;t have chosen herself a
more beautiful material; I will say that for it, scarlet or no
scarlet.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t find such a texture as that in a
shop now-a-days for love or money.&nbsp; Look at the gloss and
sheen on it, and the beautiful folds that it makes, that&rsquo;ll
never show a crease in them till years after that young
jackanapes has grown out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, I had my revenge on all of them at last when
Eric&rsquo;s letter came, confirming my statement that I had left
the original at Madrid.</p>
<p>But I question whether revenge is ever at any time
satisfactory; it certainly was not so to me.</p>
<h2><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the days that followed, my life
took a dull sad monotone, lightened at intervals by the
reflection of past memories, which lay along its path like the
sunlit pools left on a shore by the receding tide.</p>
<p>Leave-takings are bad enough at any time, unless they form the
prelude to a brighter future.&nbsp; And future before me I had
none, except a grim monotony of work in a curacy at the East End,
into which I intended to throw all the energy I could command, if
only to keep my thoughts from brooding on the past.</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>And
yet of quiet happiness there was something left me still.&nbsp;
For everyone at Fleetwater seemed sorry at my going.&nbsp; Even
Higgins, our one great Calvinist, with whom on questions of
theology the Rector and I had found ourselves at bitter feud, was
troubled at my leaving.&nbsp; He had hoped, I think, to convert
me to his theories.&nbsp; But as his arguments went chiefly to
prove that one of the great pleasures of the righteous in the
world to come would be to listen to the tortures of the wicked, I
declined his ministrations, and became to him in his own words as
&ldquo;the deaf adder that stoppeth her ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stranger still, even Peggy was sorry, now that the time had
come for me to go the way of all the curates, even though I was
fulfilling my preordained destiny, and going on the question of
Marion&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Not even the knowledge that Reggie
would soon be home again, to find a fair <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>field and
plenty of her own favour, could reconcile her wholly to the
parting.</p>
<p>And at the Rectory all was sadness and dismay.&nbsp; The
Rector seldom alluded to my going; I think he could not trust
himself.&nbsp; But the children, who had been always fond of me,
were less reticent of their grief, especially as they saw before
them a blank future, from which the wedding and its attendant
festivities had been suddenly withdrawn.</p>
<p>And still the dreary days went on.&nbsp; Each day a Good-bye
said to some one who had become a kindly friend, and each day a
Good-bye to some haunt in which Marion and I had walked and
loved.</p>
<p>If only I could have shared in her firm confidence, the task
before me would have been lightened.&nbsp; But each day I heard
news of the bank that increased more and more my
hopelessness.&nbsp; <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>Already I had been obliged to borrow
funds to meet the calls that were in prospect, and, when they
should have been paid in full, I foresaw myself starting anew in
life with a load of encumbrances about my neck that, out of a
curate&rsquo;s slender pittance, there was small hope of
reducing, granted that I could find the means of paying the
annual interest.</p>
<p>Even now I found myself hampered by the expenses necessitated
by my leaving.&nbsp; And it was in the hope of getting something
to relieve my present embarrassment that I wrote again to Eric,
reminding him of his promise, and asking him in so many words if
he had been able to do anything towards finding me a market for
the picture.</p>
<p>He delayed his answer for many days, from the difficulty, I
thought, he had found in getting any offer that he would be
warranted in accepting.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>And
then, when the last day of my time at Fleetwater was come, and I
had almost given up the hope of hearing any news from him, his
answer reached me.</p>
<h2><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Harold</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been behaving like a cad.</p>
<p>Your picture is an original Bronzino, worth quite enough to
free you from all the difficulties brought about by the
bank.&nbsp; Any copyist who could do such work could expend his
time more profitably on a picture of his own.&nbsp; Besides,
it&rsquo;s a <i>tour de force</i> in colouring that no sane
copyist would dream of imitating.&nbsp; Bronzino, I suppose,
fancied his subject, and, like some other great painters,
reproduced it in duplicate, with just the smallest <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>amount of
alteration that would serve to characterize and identify it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for my own part in this sorry business.&nbsp;
It was a mean trick, but, thank Heaven, I hadn&rsquo;t the
strength, and, I hope, not the will to carry it through.&nbsp;
You see I wanted her so badly that I couldn&rsquo;t give her up
even to you.&nbsp; And then the question of the picture turned
up, and, unluckily, I found in it my opportunity.&nbsp; Till
then, believe me, I had kept my honour safe.&nbsp; All of a
sudden, the words she had used of me on Chapel hill, the night of
the show, flashed across my mind, and I thought that, if you were
out of the way for a time, I might win her still.&nbsp; And it
<i>was</i> hard for me, you know, when I had waited for her all
these years, and had come home at last to claim her, to find that
you had won her love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, Harold, when I say I am sorry.&nbsp; I have
sinned against the friend of my youth and <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>the woman
of my love.&nbsp; But try, old friend&mdash;not now but in the
future&mdash;to win my pardon from Marion and yourself.&nbsp; You
will have time to do so, for I leave England to-morrow for the
East, and shall not return, if I ever do, till I can face your
happiness without a thought of envy or regret.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
tell Marion more than you can help.&nbsp; Old friend,
good-bye.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Eric</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;I enclose Christie and Manson&rsquo;s
receipt for your picture, which will go into their next
sale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bronzino <i>at his best</i>&rsquo; the critics
pronounce it, which in his case means a big difference.&nbsp; I
am forwarding you my own picture of &lsquo;Val Verde,&rsquo;
which I always intended for Marion.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>EPILOGUE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Eric</span>, I fancy, will never
marry.&nbsp; At least, he says so, and the words mean more with
him than they would do on the lips of other men.</p>
<p>His was not a character&mdash;I recognised at last&mdash;to
love lightly, or to change the object easily where once it had
given its love.&nbsp; In every single point he had falsified the
career which I had mapped out for him at starting.&nbsp; Not
always, it is clear, does Cicero&rsquo;s rule hold
good&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Imago animi vultus</i>; <i>indices
oculi</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Eric, for one, had demonstrated its
incompleteness.&nbsp; I had thought him <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>weak and
vacillating.&nbsp; And his weakness, if ever it existed, had
become his strength.&nbsp; Strong he had shown himself (in spite
of his own words) both for the friend of his youth and the woman
of his choice; strong to build himself a grand career; strong
above all to conquer a temptation before which the strongest
might have fallen; strong finally to fall and rise again, which
is greater and grander, I take it, than not to fall.&nbsp; True
of him, if of anyone&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That men may rise on stepping-stones<br />
Of their dead selves to higher things.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thank Heaven! there is no shadow of a cloud between us
now.&nbsp; And though I cannot look for him at Fleetwater as yet,
where the tantalising proximity of all he held most dear would
make life for a time unbearable; yet surely, most surely, I know
that we shall see him there some time, some day.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>In
appearance he is not altered much from the lad I loved at school
and college, and from whom I parted not quite three years ago in
his rooms at Trinity, starting, each of us, so confidently on the
journey of a life for which I had made forecast of such different
results.&nbsp; Only a weary look in his eyes, which time, I
think, will surely lighten; only a line or two on his forehead,
which time, I think, will surely smooth away.</p>
<p>And when he left us again for a long round of travel in Italy,
Egypt, and the East, to enlarge his ideas and find fresh subjects
for his pencil, it was with a heart full of hope and thankfulness
that I bade him Godspeed.</p>
<p>For surely, most surely, I know that we shall have him once
again with us&mdash;the Eric of the past, the dearest friend,
save one, I ever knew&mdash;to share in and complete the
happiness he had won for us out of the strong heart that only
failed him once, and <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>made out of failure a greater and
far more glorious recovery.&nbsp; For time has been quietly
perfecting its work, and when he comes to us again, we shall
meet, I know, the Eric of the future, too, uprising from the Eric
of the past.</p>

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
